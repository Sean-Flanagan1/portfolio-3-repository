       "     'selftext': '#Welcome to the 1919 r/baseball Power Ranking season!  We are celebrating our SEVENTH consecutive year of making everybody as angry as possible.\\n\\nSeven years ago, /u/naaahhman created this project and for the last six I\\'ve held the line against the gamblers seeking to steal these rankings. Alongside a diligent team, past and present, there\\'s no way anyone could ever fix the World Series...or understand our method. Coincidentally, we are the longest running r/baseball project.\\n\\nIf this is your first ballroom dance, we employ 30 voters (internet? accounts) taken from each fandom / team subreddit.  No one person has more influence than another -- especially Shoeless Joe and John Cusack -- and the fact that I\\'m a [](/SFG)Giants fan has no influence over the final rankings.\\n\\nYou will normally see this feature published on Monday between Noon and 2 PM Pacific--so, we\\'ll meet again next Monday, April 8th.\\n\\nEvery voter has their own style / system and the only voting instructions are these:\\n\\n*\"To an extent determined individually, you must take into account how strong a team is right now and likely to be going forward. You must, to some degree, give weight to the events and games of the previous week.\"*\\n\\nHowever, given the lack of data, voters were asked to treat this as a **Preseason Vote** unless they personally found compelling reasons to alter their pre-Opening Day notions of each team.\\n\\n**Thank you to all voters who have left this project -- your work has been incredibly appreciated. Those who have moved on will be acknowledged in a special way.**\\n\\nAnd if I have my way, we\\'ll be forcibly introducing y\\'all to the newer voters on the team.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________\\n\\n**TRANSPARENCY**: [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPERy28jzCm-WukH6TodvFj6Y-mIYzMAdtT3dcC7e9o/edit?usp=sharing) will show you who voted each team where and has added neat statistics!\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nIf something is a little messed up, just chalk it up to general rustiness but feel free to ~~pester me~~ let me know.\\n\\nTotal Votes: **29** of 30. So close.\\n\\nThe **delta change** somewhat irrelevantly refers to the last Power Ranking of the 2018 season for funsies.\\n______________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\\\\#||Team|Δ|Comment|Record\\n--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--\\n**1**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+6**|  |**3 -1**\\n**2**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+15**| The 2019 Phillies lineup has transformed into a powerhouse; four of the top 5 spots have been reinvigorated with new talent, headlined by Phillies new savior Bryce Harper, replacing with 6-8 with the productive players of the past, including Franco who had two HRs and knocking in 7 of the 23 runs vs the Braves. The pressure will be on the pitching staff this year; if Velasquez and Eflin could be serviceable back-end SPs, the bullpen remains healthy and the new infield defense isn\\'t as bad as last year, the team might be the team to beat in an already tough NL East. |**3 - 0**\\n**3**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-2**| The reigning champions are still at the top of my rankings because of how well they are coached, the strength of this team\\'s defense, starting pitching, and offense. Although this was an offseason marked with multiple subtractions (Kimbrel, Joe Kelly, Ian Kinsler, Drew Pomeranz, and a Steven Wright suspension), and because of those sunbtractions, there are lots of question marks surrounding this bullpen, this is still the team to beat in the American League, National League, NPB, NJPW, Indigo Plateau, you name it, Sox is tops. |**1 - 3**\\n**4**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-2**| Michael Brantley has settled in nicely to his new home. Excited to have him on the team this year! We opened the season 1-3, so naturally, the season is over and Luhnow should sell everyone and everything. Including the god awful excuse for a chicken waffle cone they sell behind the first base dugout at MMP. We visit the Rangers this week, then finally have our home opener against the Athletics.  |**1 - 3**\\n**5**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-2**| Severino being lost to mystery shoulder injury puts quite the damper on the projections for the season, but still, the Yankees look to be a force to be reckoned with this season... which we proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by losing the first series of the season to the Orioles.  Real talk, though, people like Happ in the lineup plus the lack of a frontline ace and the amazing bullpen is going to make for a lot of tense comeback wins this season, and I\\'m pretty excited. |**1 -2 **\\n**6**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+3**| Little concern going into the season with 2/3 of the key bullpen pieces in various states of injured. So far, Yelich and Cain have shown that winning 1 run games is definitely sustainable  |**3 -1**\\n**7**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-2**| Baseball is back! I\\'m excited to do my fourth year of power rankings. While nothing will top the rush of my first season as the Cubs ranker, I\\'m anxiously awaiting the results of the 2019 season. The Cubs got off to a rough start. The bats were on fire, but the bullpen was disastrous and the starting pitching showed some weakness. However, 3 games is almost stastically meaningless. Reading into the standings at all right now would be laughable, so I barely considered opening weekend results in my rankings. |**1 -2**\\n**8**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+7**| With the Nats losing 2 of 3 against the Mets, there will be plenty of panic in DC. It\\'s completely unwarranted because one loss was to deGrom. If Scherzer was able to beat deGrom, there would be a lot of chest-thumping going on in the nation\\'s capital. NOTE: My rankings are based on \"what have you done\" vs \"what do I think you will do\" |**1 -2**\\n**9**|[](/CLE)|**Indians**|**-3**| The Tribe rolls into 2019 with the best rotation in baseball and only one real competitor in the Twins.  A division title seems likely, but will questions marks in the outfield and the bullpen be their Achilles heel? |**1 -2**\\n**10**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**+1**| cards probably should have finished sunday 2-2 but bad opening series are SOP for STL and that\\'s conveniently ignoring that the brew crew is a good team that\\'s probably still getting better. |**1 -3**\\n**11**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**-1**| The Rays enter 2019 with high hopes, but will the baseball gods\\' light shine upon them? The new compliments to Kiermaier have come out of the gate strong, and there is a glut of infield talent that runs deep into the farm. It\\'s fun to note that the worst pitching performance thus far was the reigning Cy Young winner, and the bullpen has yet to allow a run. The temperature in the water is feeling just right to go full flap ahead. First series highlights include Yonny Chirinos going a strong 7 innings, Austin Meadows showing some muscle with 2HR, and Choi Boi antics in the field. Let\\'s go Rays! |**3 -1**\\n**12**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**+7**| The Mets\\' offseason (the first under Brodie Van Wagenen) was ... a mixed-bag. Robinson Canó\\'s contract seems to be a likely albatross, though he is looking OK for now. Edwin Díaz hopefully will be able to do well. While Kelenic was hyped, he was still an unproven prospect—plus, we got rid of Jay Bruce and Anthony Swarzak (sorry, Jay and Anthony, if you\\'re reading). I don\\'t understand the J. D. Davis trade at all—he is a fine organizational guy, but I don\\'t see why we traded for him; hopefully he\\'ll prove me wrong. Oh, and Bryce Harper is the most overrated player in baseball. |**2 -1**\\n**13**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**-9**| After going across the globe just to lose twice to the Mariners in a quasi-opening matchup, the A\\'s opened the season at home against the Angels. Even though Trout did Trout things, we took two of three from them. Our starters have 24 straight scoreless innings, which is flabbergasting because we have a rotting pile of garbage as our current rotation. Don\\'t even bother looking them up, I\\'m too embarrased. Needless to say, if Fiers and Estrada have a good April and May they\\'ll be around, but we\\'re just trying to escape. The bats are as alive as ever, Khris Davis is going to hit a billion home runs and we play the Red Sox this week at home.  |**3 - 3**\\n**14**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**-8**| Braves were absolutely brutalized by the Phillies. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Fingers crossed this isn\\'t a sign of something. |**0 -3**\\n**15**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**-3**| Colorado\\'s outlook for 2019 is more or less the exact same as it was for 2018. The rotation is great and the lineup is good enough, but there\\'s not much depth and the team still has glaring holes. We\\'re far from a playoff lock, but barring some serious injuries I fully expect to be in the mix come late September. Tl;dr fuck the Dodgers |**2 -2**\\n**16**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-3**| I had no idea what to expect coming into this season, but this certantly wasn\\'t it. Mariners offense seems to be *almost* unstoppable. They\\'ve gone into the 9th with a lead or tied every game so far. The thing holding them back is easily the bullpen, although we\\'ll see what Felix offers us tonight. Sign Kimbrel. |**5 -1**\\n**17**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+9**| Honestly wow. Here I was thinking that this would be another year of purgatory before the ball started rolling, but rockstar GM A.J. Prellar kicked us off early. Of course everyone is estatic that we locked up Manny for a minimum of five years, but we also got to see Tatis and Paddack on opening weekend, which is a sign from the organization that we aren\\'t waiting around. Everything is pointing to the rebuild being over, and our climb to relevance just beginning. That being said, with the youth of the team needing to develop, and the lack of starting pitching depth, it would be hard for me to predict playoffs this year. I think we\\'re in the 77-82 win range, which would still be a big improvement. We started off the seaon by taking 3/4 against the Giants, couldn\\'t have asked for a better start. |**3 -1**\\n**18**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+2**| An encouraging Opening Weekend, going 2-1 against the Indians while being two wild pitches and a timely hit away from a sweep. With a solid rotation, a competent bullpen, impressive defense, and an explosive offense (when not facing top-10 pitchers), they look ready to challenge the Indians and turn the AL Central into a real horserace. Bright spots include Berrios pitching a gem, Buxton looking strong at the plate (4-for-10 with 3 doubles!), and our new additions already contributing. |**2 - 1**\\n**19**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-1**| If you ask what the strength of this Angels team is, I think the offense would be the answer by default, and only because of one guy. Mike Trout projects to account for more than a third of their position player value. Outside of him, it\\'s difficult to find notable sources of contribution. Ohtani, Skaggs, and Upton - probably in that order - are interesting enough players, but betting on any of their health right now with basically one-and-a-half of them gone is not particularly prudent. It\\'s a story that has become the norm for the better part of a decade for this team with the only changes being the cast. |**1 - 3**\\n**20**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+4**| This is technically my preseason blurb, so I\\'ll table any Derek Dietrich overreactions that I have (and I have plenty.)  Maybe it was because I had to write 100 words on the team at the end of every week, but I was a little more optimistic after the Reds\\' 67-win 2018 than most. Sure, they won fewer games than the year before, but several players took clear steps in the right direction. And they followed that up with a tremendous offseason. After completely revamping their coaching staff, the Reds filled their biggest need by acquiring 3 capable starting pitchers without giving up any of their top 6 prospects, while also cutting ties with their two biggest negative contributors from the past couple seasons. I still can\\'t believe they managed to get rid of Homer. All in all, the NL Central is going to be a bloodbath, but the Reds have what it takes to keep it interesting for a little while. |**1 - 1**\\n**21**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-5**| Pitching, pitching, pitching. The Pirates\\' 2019 season will go as far as the men on the mound can take them. In a tight NL Central race, the Bucs are projected by Fangraphs to have the best rotation and bullpen in the division. The question will be whether the Pirates can score any runs. The best hitter of the 2018 campaign, Gregory Polanco, is still recovering from shoulder surgery. Starling Marte and orey Dickerson are good, but each is over 30 and getting older. The Pirates will need big seasons from guys like Adam Frazier, Josh Bell and Jung-ho Kang or there will be a lot of frustraitng, low scoring losses. |**1 - 1**\\n**22**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**0**| The Blue Jays Starting Pitchers opened the season going 24 innings without giving up a run. The best since the \\'94 Barves. Sure, it was against the Tigers, and sure, they still split the series. But promising appearances from Trent Thornton and the first ever appearance by a player born in the 21st century, Elvis Luciano, prove that there are plenty of reasons to watch this team. And that\\'s without a certain \"injured\" consenus #1 prospect. |**2 - 2**\\n**23**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**-9**| The D-backs were deservingly punished by the baseball gods in their opening series at the Dodgers. The offense, led by Christin Walker, looks better thn advertised, but the pitching has been a dumpster fire inside of a burning building on the sun |**1 - 3**\\n**24**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**-1**| D.R.E.A.M. Dingers Rule Everything Around Me. |**2 - 1**\\n**25**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-4**| Well you can\\'t say that the team doesn\\'t look different in the Farhan Zaidi era. The unofficial official rebuild begins this year, not with a bang, but with a whimper, as we have the likes of Connor Joe, Michael Reed, and Yangervis Solarte in the everyday lineup. Who the hell are Connor Joe and Michael Reed? Who the hell cares? Last year we had delusions of grandeur of competing, this year we have delusions of grandeur of being able to out-tank the Orioles and Tigers for that sweet sweet #1 overall pick in 2020. If the 2019 Giants win more than 65 games, I\\'ll be shocked. |**1 - 3**\\n**26**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**+3**| Holy Aesop, Kyle Zimmer exists!!! All sarcasm aside, it was great to see him finally make his long awaited major league debut and to notch his first strikeout. Hopefully, this is the first of many, and Zimmer can become a key member of the Royals bullpen for years to come. |**2 - 1**\\n**27**|[](/CHW)|**Black Sox**|**0**| If the White Sox are going to float this sinking ship, it needs to start, like, right now. Giolito and Moncada looking like world beaters VERY early is a start |**1 - 2**\\n**28**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-3**| One weekend in and we\\'ve already had a big scare: Miguel got hit by a pitch on his hand. It appears things went alright (he DH\\'d and hit two balls to the warning track the next day), but if he goes down again for a long period of time, the Tigers will be challenging the Orioles for the worst record in the Bigs. This will certainly be a trying type of year, with plenty of spots to be had for players that would like to step up. Next week: 3 at NYY, 3 vs. KCR. |**2 - 2**\\n**29**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**-1**| Were in year 2 of Jeters rebuild, so the Fish are gonna lose around 100 games. Pitching will likely be stronger this year given the raw talent on the rotation (Urena, Richards, Lopez, Alcantara and Smith) and depth in the minors. The potential to have a top 10 rotation in the league within the next couple years is a very real possibility. Counterpoint: the offense will likely remain inconsistent until more talent comes up from the minors. TLDR: marlins will struggle to not lose 100 games and will start building on a very solid foundation of young players. 2021 WS champs you heard it here first! |**2 - 2**\\n**30**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**0**| This is my first time doing this and my rankings will change throughout, one thing I can guarantee is my favorite team the Orioles will probably stay at the bottom.  That makes it a tad easier lol. |**2 -1 **\\n',\n",

Alongside a diligent team, past and present, there&amp;#39;s no way anyone could ever fix the World Series...or understand our method. Coincidentally, we are the longest running &lt;a href=\"/r/baseball\"&gt;r/baseball&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If this is your first ballroom dance, we employ 30 voters (internet? accounts) taken from each fandom / team subreddit.  No one person has more influence than another -- especially Shoeless Joe and John Cusack -- and the fact that I&amp;#39;m a &lt;a href=\"/SFG\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Giants fan has no influence over the final rankings.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will normally see this feature published on Monday between Noon and 2 PM Pacific--so, we&amp;#39;ll meet again next Monday, April 8th.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Every voter has their own style / system and the only voting instructions are these:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;To an extent determined individually, you must take into account how strong a team is right now and likely to be going forward. You must, to some degree, give weight to the events and games of the previous week.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, given the lack of data, voters were asked to treat this as a &lt;strong&gt;Preseason Vote&lt;/strong&gt; unless they personally found compelling reasons to alter their pre-Opening Day notions of each team.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you to all voters who have left this project -- your work has been incredibly appreciated. Those who have moved on will be acknowledged in a special way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And if I have my way, we&amp;#39;ll be forcibly introducing y&amp;#39;all to the newer voters on the team.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRANSPARENCY&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPERy28jzCm-WukH6TodvFj6Y-mIYzMAdtT3dcC7e9o/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; will show you who voted each team where and has added neat statistics!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If something is a little messed up, just chalk it up to general rustiness but feel free to &lt;del&gt;pester me&lt;/del&gt; let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Total Votes: &lt;strong&gt;29&lt;/strong&gt; of 30.

The pressure will be on the pitching staff this year; if Velasquez and Eflin could be serviceable back-end SPs, the bullpen remains healthy and the new infield defense isn&amp;#39;t as bad as last year, the team might be the team to beat in an already tough NL East.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 - 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/BOS\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Sox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;The reigning champions are still at the top of my rankings because of how well they are coached, the strength of this team&amp;#39;s defense, starting pitching, and offense. Although this was an offseason marked with multiple subtractions (Kimbrel, Joe Kelly, Ian Kinsler, Drew Pomeranz, and a Steven Wright suspension), and because of those sunbtractions, there are lots of question marks surrounding this bullpen, this is still the team to beat in the American League, National League, NPB, NJPW, Indigo Plateau, you name it, Sox is tops.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/HOU\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Michael Brantley has settled in nicely to his new home. Excited to have him on the team this year! We opened the season 1-3, so naturally, the season is over and Luhnow should sell everyone and everything. Including the god awful excuse for a chicken waffle cone they sell behind the first base dugout at MMP. We visit the Rangers this week, then finally have our home opener against the Athletics.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/NYY\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yankees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Severino being lost to mystery shoulder injury puts quite the damper on the projections for the season, but still, the Yankees look to be a force to be reckoned with this season... which we proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by losing the first series of the season to the Orioles.  Real talk, though, people like Happ in the lineup plus the lack of a frontline ace and the amazing bullpen is going to make for a lot of tense comeback wins this season, and I&amp;#39;m pretty excited.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;*&lt;em&gt;1 -2 *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/MIL\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Little concern going into the season with 2/3 of the key bullpen pieces in various states of injured. So far, Yelich and Cain have shown that winning 1 run games is definitely sustainable&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/CHC1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cubs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Baseball is back! I&amp;#39;m excited to do my fourth year of power rankings. While nothing will top the rush of my first season as the Cubs ranker, I&amp;#39;m anxiously awaiting the results of the 2019 season. The Cubs got off to a rough start. The bats were on fire, but the bullpen was disastrous and the starting pitching showed some weakness. However, 3 games is almost stastically meaningless. Reading into the standings at all right now would be laughable, so I barely considered opening weekend results in my rankings.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/WSH\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nationals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;With the Nats losing 2 of 3 against the Mets, there will be plenty of panic in DC. It&amp;#39;s completely unwarranted because one loss was to deGrom. If Scherzer was able to beat deGrom, there would be a lot of chest-thumping going on in the nation&amp;#39;s capital. NOTE: My rankings are based on &amp;quot;what have you done&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;what do I think you will do&amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/CLE\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;The Tribe rolls into 2019 with the best rotation in baseball and only one real competitor in the Twins.  A division title seems likely, but will questions marks in the outfield and the bullpen be their Achilles heel?&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/STL\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardinals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;cards probably should have finished sunday 2-2 but bad opening series are SOP for STL and that&amp;#39;s conveniently ignoring that the brew crew is a good team that&amp;#39;s probably still getting better.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/TB\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;The Rays enter 2019 with high hopes, but will the baseball gods&amp;#39; light shine upon them? The new compliments to Kiermaier have come out of the gate strong, and there is a glut of infield talent that runs deep into the farm. It&amp;#39;s fun to note that the worst pitching performance thus far was the reigning Cy Young winner, and the bullpen has yet to allow a run. The temperature in the water is feeling just right to go full flap ahead. First series highlights include Yonny Chirinos going a strong 7 innings, Austin Meadows showing some muscle with 2HR, and Choi Boi antics in the field. Let&amp;#39;s go Rays!&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/NYM\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;The Mets&amp;#39; offseason (the first under Brodie Van Wagenen) was ... a mixed-bag. Robinson Canó&amp;#39;s contract seems to be a likely albatross, though he is looking OK for now. Edwin Díaz hopefully will be able to do well. While Kelenic was hyped, he was still an unproven prospect—plus, we got rid of Jay Bruce and Anthony Swarzak (sorry, Jay and Anthony, if you&amp;#39;re reading). I don&amp;#39;t understand the J. D. Davis trade at all—he is a fine organizational guy, but I don&amp;#39;t see why we traded for him; hopefully he&amp;#39;ll prove me wrong. Oh, and Bryce Harper is the most overrated player in baseball.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/OAK\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Athletics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;After going across the globe just to lose twice to the Mariners in a quasi-opening matchup, the A&amp;#39;s opened the season at home against the Angels. Even though Trout did Trout things, we took two of three from them. Our starters have 24 straight scoreless innings, which is flabbergasting because we have a rotting pile of garbage as our current rotation. Don&amp;#39;t even bother looking them up, I&amp;#39;m too embarrased. Needless to say, if Fiers and Estrada have a good April and May they&amp;#39;ll be around, but we&amp;#39;re just trying to escape.

No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Fingers crossed this isn&amp;#39;t a sign of something.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 -3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/COL\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rockies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Colorado&amp;#39;s outlook for 2019 is more or less the exact same as it was for 2018. The rotation is great and the lineup is good enough, but there&amp;#39;s not much depth and the team still has glaring holes. We&amp;#39;re far from a playoff lock, but barring some serious injuries I fully expect to be in the mix come late September. Tl;dr fuck the Dodgers&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/SEA\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;I had no idea what to expect coming into this season, but this certantly wasn&amp;#39;t it. Mariners offense seems to be &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; unstoppable. They&amp;#39;ve gone into the 9th with a lead or tied every game so far. The thing holding them back is easily the bullpen, although we&amp;#39;ll see what Felix offers us tonight. Sign Kimbrel.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/SD\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Padres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Honestly wow. Here I was thinking that this would be another year of purgatory before the ball started rolling, but rockstar GM A.J. Prellar kicked us off early. Of course everyone is estatic that we locked up Manny for a minimum of five years, but we also got to see Tatis and Paddack on opening weekend, which is a sign from the organization that we aren&amp;#39;t waiting around. Everything is pointing to the rebuild being over, and our climb to relevance just beginning. That being said, with the youth of the team needing to develop, and the lack of starting pitching depth, it would be hard for me to predict playoffs this year. I think we&amp;#39;re in the 77-82 win range, which would still be a big improvement. We started off the seaon by taking 3/4 against the Giants, couldn&amp;#39;t have asked for a better start.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/MIN\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;An encouraging Opening Weekend, going 2-1 against the Indians while being two wild pitches and a timely hit away from a sweep. With a solid rotation, a competent bullpen, impressive defense, and an explosive offense (when not facing top-10 pitchers), they look ready to challenge the Indians and turn the AL Central into a real horserace. Bright spots include Berrios pitching a gem, Buxton looking strong at the plate (4-for-10 with 3 doubles!), and our new additions already contributing.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/LAA\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;If you ask what the strength of this Angels team is, I think the offense would be the answer by default, and only because of one guy. Mike Trout projects to account for more than a third of their position player value. Outside of him, it&amp;#39;s difficult to find notable sources of contribution. Ohtani, Skaggs, and Upton - probably in that order - are interesting enough players, but betting on any of their health right now with basically one-and-a-half of them gone is not particularly prudent. It&amp;#39;s a story that has become the norm for the better part of a decade for this team with the only changes being the cast.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/CIN\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;This is technically my preseason blurb, so I&amp;#39;ll table any Derek Dietrich overreactions that I have (and I have plenty.)  Maybe it was because I had to write 100 words on the team at the end of every week, but I was a little more optimistic after the Reds&amp;#39; 67-win 2018 than most. Sure, they won fewer games than the year before, but several players took clear steps in the right direction. And they followed that up with a tremendous offseason. After completely revamping their coaching staff, the Reds filled their biggest need by acquiring 3 capable starting pitchers without giving up any of their top 6 prospects, while also cutting ties with their two biggest negative contributors from the past couple seasons. I still can&amp;#39;t believe they managed to get rid of Homer. All in all, the NL Central is going to be a bloodbath, but the Reds have what it takes to keep it interesting for a little while.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/PIT\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pirates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Pitching, pitching, pitching. The Pirates&amp;#39; 2019 season will go as far as the men on the mound can take them. In a tight NL Central race, the Bucs are projected by Fangraphs to have the best rotation and bullpen in the division. The question will be whether the Pirates can score any runs. The best hitter of the 2018 campaign, Gregory Polanco, is still recovering from shoulder surgery. Starling Marte and orey Dickerson are good, but each is over 30 and getting older. The Pirates will need big seasons from guys like Adam Frazier, Josh Bell and Jung-ho Kang or there will be a lot of frustraitng, low scoring losses.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/TOR\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Jays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;The Blue Jays Starting Pitchers opened the season going 24 innings without giving up a run. The best since the &amp;#39;94 Barves. Sure, it was against the Tigers, and sure, they still split the series. But promising appearances from Trent Thornton and the first ever appearance by a player born in the 21st century, Elvis Luciano, prove that there are plenty of reasons to watch this team. And that&amp;#39;s without a certain &amp;quot;injured&amp;quot; consenus #1 prospect.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ARI\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D-Backs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;The D-backs were deservingly punished by the baseball gods in their opening series at the Dodgers. The offense, led by Christin Walker, looks better thn advertised, but the pitching has been a dumpster fire inside of a burning building on the sun&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/TEX\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rangers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;D.R.E.A.M.

The unofficial official rebuild begins this year, not with a bang, but with a whimper, as we have the likes of Connor Joe, Michael Reed, and Yangervis Solarte in the everyday lineup. Who the hell are Connor Joe and Michael Reed? Who the hell cares? Last year we had delusions of grandeur of competing, this year we have delusions of grandeur of being able to out-tank the Orioles and Tigers for that sweet sweet #1 overall pick in 2020. If the 2019 Giants win more than 65 games, I&amp;#39;ll be shocked.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/KCR\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Holy Aesop, Kyle Zimmer exists!!! All sarcasm aside, it was great to see him finally make his long awaited major league debut and to notch his first strikeout. Hopefully, this is the first of many, and Zimmer can become a key member of the Royals bullpen for years to come.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/CHW\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Sox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;If the White Sox are going to float this sinking ship, it needs to start, like, right now.

It appears things went alright (he DH&amp;#39;d and hit two balls to the warning track the next day), but if he goes down again for a long period of time, the Tigers will be challenging the Orioles for the worst record in the Bigs. This will certainly be a trying type of year, with plenty of spots to be had for players that would like to step up. Next week: 3 at NYY, 3 vs. KCR.&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/MIA\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marlins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;Were in year 2 of Jeters rebuild, so the Fish are gonna lose around 100 games. Pitching will likely be stronger this year given the raw talent on the rotation (Urena, Richards, Lopez, Alcantara and Smith) and depth in the minors. The potential to have a top 10 rotation in the league within the next couple years is a very real possibility. Counterpoint: the offense will likely remain inconsistent until more talent comes up from the minors. TLDR: marlins will struggle to not lose 100 games and will start building on a very solid foundation of young players. 2021 WS champs you heard it here first!&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"right\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/BAL\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orioles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td align=\"center\"&gt;This is my first time doing this and my rankings will change throughout, one thing I can guarantee is my favorite team the Orioles will probably stay at the bottom.

I won't stand for it. The game was objectively better in the 00s and into the early 10s, but lately has been absolute rubbish.\\n\\nFor starters, the outlawing of the spitball is outrageous! Why shouldn't pitchers be allowed to place their bodily fluid on the baseballs? If they want to risk their own immune system, they should be able to do so at their own risk. On top of that, it won't be much of a risk to their health, because they will be able to cure themselves with a cigarette in the dugout.\\n\\nOn top of that, the nerve of the MLB to use new balls rather than having those hit out of play be returned to the field of play?! Outrageous! I need money to go to jazz clubs and burlesque shows - I won't let the banks tax me more to fund more baseballs! Thankfully the economy should be in great shape for at least the next 30 years so I can have children and allow then to reach adulthood in a good world climate, now that the Great War has ended.\\n\\nAs for the balls themselves, these jackrabbit balls are a conspiracy from the league office themselves!

I won&amp;#39;t stand for it. The game was objectively better in the 00s and into the early 10s, but lately has been absolute rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For starters, the outlawing of the spitball is outrageous! Why shouldn&amp;#39;t pitchers be allowed to place their bodily fluid on the baseballs? If they want to risk their own immune system, they should be able to do so at their own risk. On top of that, it won&amp;#39;t be much of a risk to their health, because they will be able to cure themselves with a cigarette in the dugout.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the nerve of the MLB to use new balls rather than having those hit out of play be returned to the field of play?! Outrageous! I need money to go to jazz clubs and burlesque shows - I won&amp;#39;t let the banks tax me more to fund more baseballs! Thankfully the economy should be in great shape for at least the next 30 years so I can have children and allow then to reach adulthood in a good world climate, now that the Great War has ended.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As for the balls themselves, these jackrabbit balls are a conspiracy from the league office themselves! I won&amp;#39;t stand for it! Who is with me!?!?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
