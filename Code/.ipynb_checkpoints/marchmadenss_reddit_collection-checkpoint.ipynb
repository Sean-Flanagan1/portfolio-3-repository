I know that no lead is safe.  That is why going into the Virginia game, I expected Purdue to lose, but then they opened up the game well and had a lead.  I started to hope just a little, but I knew Virginia was a good team and no lead is safe.  When they took the 3 points off the board, I knew that cost us the game.  (I think it was probably the right call, but I also could\\'ve seen them let the call on the floor stand since it was so close it was hard to say with certainty).  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPurdue inflicted a lot of damage on itself not playing good defense for 30 minutes of the game (really only in the last 10 minutes did they start to play better defense).  They continued missing FTs...and the one Cline missed ultimately was the deciding factor.  But the thing that bothered me most was that they were terrible at rebounding.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI could assign some blame to the refs.  There was the blown call on the possession of that out-of-bounds situation where it clearly showed the ball being last touched by Virginia, but they gave the ball to them.  There was the travelling no-call that resulted in points for Virginia, or the two or three offensive fouls that weren\\'t called when the Virginia guy pushed off before taking a shot they made.  I\\'m sure I\\'m biased and overlooked similar no calls that favored Purdue, but it definitely impacted the game\\'s outcome, and may have contributed to Purdue\\'s rebounding woes since they had just played a game where the refs were calling touch fouls and suddenly were in a game with completely new foul rules - they were slow to adapt, and that\\'s on them.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut the thing that killed me was that Virginia was the better team but Edwards was the best talent out there.  Any other year, we would\\'ve lost by double digits once Virginia took that five point lead, but Edwards kept them in the game.  Haarms came alive defensively and kept them in the game.  And suddenly, just like that, we had a 2 point lead late in the game....when Cline was fouled, with just seconds to play, it was the closest thing to excitement that this emotionally-deadened Purdue fan could feel.  I said \"This is a favorable situation!\"  We have a chance for a two-score lead with little time left - maybe we can pull this off!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the thing that killed about this game.  We had it.  This was our shot.  Even the rest of the stars aligned - Auburn knocked out NC and KY and lost a star player - we could\\'ve beaten them.  MSU knocked out Duke and Gonzaga was out...we could\\'ve beaten them.  Not saying either game would\\'ve been a gimme, but it would\\'ve been closer to a coin toss, and if any of those many things went just a little in our favor, we had a shot at the title this year.  Instead, we remain capped.  Their last final four trip was the year I was born (before I was born).  I have not, and likely never will, see my team in the Final Four.

There was the blown call on the possession of that out-of-bounds situation where it clearly showed the ball being last touched by Virginia, but they gave the ball to them.  There was the travelling no-call that resulted in points for Virginia, or the two or three offensive fouls that weren&amp;#39;t called when the Virginia guy pushed off before taking a shot they made.  I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m biased and overlooked similar no calls that favored Purdue, but it definitely impacted the game&amp;#39;s outcome, and may have contributed to Purdue&amp;#39;s rebounding woes since they had just played a game where the refs were calling touch fouls and suddenly were in a game with completely new foul rules - they were slow to adapt, and that&amp;#39;s on them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But the thing that killed me was that Virginia was the better team but Edwards was the best talent out there.  Any other year, we would&amp;#39;ve lost by double digits once Virginia took that five point lead, but Edwards kept them in the game.  Haarms came alive defensively and kept them in the game.  And suddenly, just like that, we had a 2 point lead late in the game....when Cline was fouled, with just seconds to play, it was the closest thing to excitement that this emotionally-deadened Purdue fan could feel.  I said &amp;quot;This is a favorable situation!&amp;quot;  We have a chance for a two-score lead with little time left - maybe we can pull this off!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the thing that killed about this game.  We had it.  This was our shot.  Even the rest of the stars aligned - Auburn knocked out NC and KY and lost a star player - we could&amp;#39;ve beaten them.  MSU knocked out Duke and Gonzaga was out...we could&amp;#39;ve beaten them.  Not saying either game would&amp;#39;ve been a gimme, but it would&amp;#39;ve been closer to a coin toss, and if any of those many things went just a little in our favor, we had a shot at the title this year.  Instead, we remain capped.  Their last final four trip was the year I was born (before I was born).  I have not, and likely never will, see my team in the Final Four.  And the curse continues....&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"I know that many of us American's have bracket pools for the madness that is the NCAA tournament and winning it can be lucrative. My group this year has more participants than ever which is why I am curious what you all would do in my shoes. Only one bracket out of 35 has a champion remaining. Only a handful of people even have a team left that they picked to go to the title game. There are only two people left that can win the pool and it's either Ricky or myself.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nYou see, Ricky chose Michigan State to win the title and I chose UNC. I have Michigan State in the final though, which is crucial. I am also crushing Ricky right now with 840 points to his 690 and leading the other remaining brackets that have MSU in the final but not winning it all. So Ricky needs MSU to win two more games and the title in order to beat me. I win if Texas Tech OR Virginia OR Auburn win it all.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe pool has a pretty substantial sum of money and I was thinking of approaching Ricky with a proposition. Since I figure my three teams have a better chance combined than his one maybe I make him an offer he can't refuse... or at least consider negotiating. I am willing to sacrifice 25% of the money right now while I take the remaining 75% and say the challenge is over. Pay him off. Why you may ask? Well, I think MSU is going to win it. They have the only coach left of the four remaining teams with any final four experience let alone a championship trophy on his mantle. The Spartan's are littered with upper-class, tough, grind-it-out-type players. They play great defense when they need to. They score when they need to. They won't face another team nearly the caliber of Duke the rest of the way, and definitely no player like Zion Williamson. I feel as though they are the team of destiny, but do you feel the same as me? I need your input on what I should do. Do I offer him a portion of the money or let it ride and hope someone can knock them out?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: I offered him 33%. He didn't take it. So I offered him 25%, told him I would take 50% and we can let it play out for the other 25%, he didn't take it. At this point, it looks as though we are going to push all the chips to the middle and let the basketball gods determine a winner... FYI, I think MSU is winning this tournament. Dang.\",\n",
