I was there when Brees played.  I've seen us get blown out in the Rose Bowl.  Seen countless good runs ended by an improbable bounce or an ACL tear.  I know that no lead is safe.  That is why going into the Virginia game, I expected Purdue to lose, but then they opened up the game well and had a lead.  I started to hope just a little, but I knew Virginia was a good team and no lead is safe.  When they took the 3 points off the board, I knew that cost us the game.  (I think it was probably the right call, but I also could've seen them let the call on the floor stand since it was so close it was hard to say with certainty).  

&amp;#x200B;

Purdue inflicted a lot of damage on itself not playing good defense for 30 minutes of the game (really only in the last 10 minutes did they start to play better defense).  They continued missing FTs...and the one Cline missed ultimately was the deciding factor.  But the thing that bothered me most was that they were terrible at rebounding.

&amp;#x200B;

I could assign some blame to the refs.  There was the blown call on the possession of that out-of-bounds situation where it clearly showed the ball being last touched by Virginia, but they gave the ball to them.  There was the travelling no-call that resulted in points for Virginia, or the two or three offensive fouls that weren't called when the Virginia guy pushed off before taking a shot they made.  I'm sure I'm biased and overlooked similar no calls that favored Purdue, but it definitely impacted the game's outcome, and may have contributed to Purdue's rebounding woes since they had just played a game where the refs were calling touch fouls and suddenly were in a game with completely new foul rules - they were slow to adapt, and that's on them.

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing that killed me was that Virginia was the better team but Edwards was the best talent out there.  Any other year, we would've lost by double digits once Virginia took that five point lead, but Edwards kept them in the game.  Haarms came alive defensively and kept them in the game.  And suddenly, just like that, we had a 2 point lead late in the game....when Cline was fouled, with just seconds to play, it was the closest thing to excitement that this emotionally-deadened Purdue fan could feel.  I said ""This is a favorable situation!""  We have a chance for a two-score lead with little time left - maybe we can pull this off!

&amp;#x200B;

And that's the thing that killed about this game.  We had it.  This was our shot.  Even the rest of the stars aligned - Auburn knocked out NC and KY and lost a star player - we could've beaten them.  MSU knocked out Duke and Gonzaga was out...we could've beaten them.  Not saying either game would've been a gimme, but it would've been closer to a coin toss, and if any of those many things went just a little in our favor, we had a shot at the title this year.  Instead, we remain capped.  Their last final four trip was the year I was born (before I was born).  I have not, and likely never will, see my team in the Final Four.

My group this year has more participants than ever which is why I am curious what you all would do in my shoes. Only one bracket out of 35 has a champion remaining. Only a handful of people even have a team left that they picked to go to the title game. There are only two people left that can win the pool and it's either Ricky or myself.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, Ricky chose Michigan State to win the title and I chose UNC. I have Michigan State in the final though, which is crucial. I am also crushing Ricky right now with 840 points to his 690 and leading the other remaining brackets that have MSU in the final but not winning it all. So Ricky needs MSU to win two more games and the title in order to beat me. I win if Texas Tech OR Virginia OR Auburn win it all.

&amp;#x200B;

The pool has a pretty substantial sum of money and I was thinking of approaching Ricky with a proposition. Since I figure my three teams have a better chance combined than his one maybe I make him an offer he can't refuse... or at least consider negotiating. I am willing to sacrifice 25% of the money right now while I take the remaining 75% and say the challenge is over. Pay him off. Why you may ask? Well, I think MSU is going to win it. They have the only coach left of the four remaining teams with any final four experience let alone a championship trophy on his mantle. The Spartan's are littered with upper-class, tough, grind-it-out-type players. They play great defense when they need to. They score when they need to. They won't face another team nearly the caliber of Duke the rest of the way, and definitely no player like Zion Williamson. I feel as though they are the team of destiny, but do you feel the same as me? I need your input on what I should do. Do I offer him a portion of the money or let it ride and hope someone can knock them out?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I offered him 33%. He didn't take it. So I offered him 25%, told him I would take 50% and we can let it play out for the other 25%, he didn't take it. At this point, it looks as though we are going to push all the chips to the middle and let the basketball gods determine a winner... FYI, I think MSU is winning this tournament.

To raise money we are doing a bracket that is only $1 to enter and you can win a little bit of money too. We are at about $900 towards our goal of $2,000.

Too High: 

* \#5 Marquette - They didn't win 25 games, didn't win their conference, didn't win their conference tourney (didn't even make the final), and they get a fairly high seed. I feel like they should be a 6 or a 7. 
* \#3 Michigan - Although I wouldn't have them much lower, I feel like Houston should have had the last 2-seed. 30 wins for a high-mid-major is huge. Can't be too mad about it though when they just lost by double-digits in the conference tourney championship. I think if they won that they'd have been a 2. 

Too Low: 

* \#2 Michigan State - Should have gotten the last 1-seed over Gonzaga, plain and simple. As a mid-major you have to win your conference tourney to get a 1-seed. That Duke W really saved their skin, but Sparty was just more battle-tested. You can't beat another 2-seed three times in one season and have 28 wins from a power conference (and win that conference tourney) and not get a 1-seed. 
* \#7 Cincinnati - 28 wins in a high-mid-major, won that mid-major conference tourney by double-digits over a 30-win Houston. Not sure how that all justifies a 7-seed, especially with teams like Marquette, Wisconsin, Iowa State and Maryland all being seeded higher than them with none of those teams winning more than 24 games or winning their conference tourneys (except Iowa St).

I am no expert in NCAAB, but I LOVE statistics.

These rankings are based off of statistics retrieved from [teamrankings.com](https://teamrankings.com/) and [https://kenpom.com](https://kenpom.com). Kenpom has become a trusted NCAA statistical genius over the past decade and his KenPom rankings have accurately chosen upsets in the past, so KenPom will be heavily baked into these rankings.

The statistics used are based off of the 4 Factors of Basketball: Scoring, Rebounding, Turnovers, and Free Throws. Instead of using the original stats (eFG%, REB%, TO%, FTA/FTM), I used True Shooting % and FTM/100 possessions and kept REB% and TO%. I performed regression tests in Excel and found that these 4 were a better fit for predicting wins than the original 4. I found the coefficients in the regression equation for each of the 8 stats, 4 stats for offense and 4 stats on the defensive end. (Ex: offensive rebounding% and defensive rebounding%). I applied weights calculated in the equation to each teams Z score of 4 Factors. In simpler words, I put all 8 stats on an even spread and added weights based on the regression to make sure not one stat had an advantage because it was a bigger number (TO% would be less than TS%, meaning TO% wouldn't mean as much unless they were both put into a Z score).

I then took KenPom's Adjusted Strength of Schedule statistic and found the Z Score of each teams schedule strength. I added this to the 4 Factors Z Score found earlier to get the final team evaluation number. This adjustment allows teams that look good on paper who played all easy teams to be properly ranked, like Cincinnati. They have one of the strongest statistical spreads of any team, but have not played many top level teams.

There are a few thing you can infer from these numbers. First of all, Maryland is extremely weak. They have a negative 4 Factors score and a medium SoS. They are definitely an upset candidate at the 5 seed. Also, teams like Texas and Florida have the ability to upset teams due to their higher 4FS and SoS.

A final note to make is that these rankings do not take into account injuries. For example, Duke is favored to make the Final 4 at least according to this model, but with Zion questionable, they might not have that ceiling anymore.

Thanks for checking this out and have fun with the all the madness. Your thoughts would be appreciated. Your predictions are as good as mine. 

Enjoy!!

Hi everyone! I'm not a regular member here posting wise but I've been visiting this sub for close to a year now. In hopes of adding quality people to our community, and hopefully sending some the way of r/marchmadness as well, I wanted to leave you with a brief message for people into Be a Pro Sims, Sim Leagues, or Basketball in general.

The Simulation Basketball Association (SBA) is the ultimate in online basketball simulations. Having just celebrated our 35th season of existence, the SBA allows you to control your own destiny and become a legend on the court! If you're a fan of My Career in NBA2K you'll love the SBA as you get to emulate the life of a rising basketball star. Will you be the next MJ or LeBron? Or maybe you'll be a key role player on a Championship squad! Will you be the team leader in your locker room or will you be making the headlines every day as drama follows you everywhere?

From the very moment you join, you begin customizing your own career. You create your own player to the specifications you prefer and then guide him or her through their career. You determine which of our **24 colleges (FOUR new expansions)** you'll attend to start your development, and from there you'll determine how your player improves and develops by using points earned from a variety of tasks and activities around the league. After that you'll be drafted to one of our **16 professional teams** in the SBA. You can earn and sign contracts, go through free agency, be traded, become an all-star and try to win a championship. Your player is truly your own! You earn points for improvement by writing short articles, creating graphics or videos, recording podcasts, participating in league events, training camps and more. These points are applied to any of the **16** attributes at your disposal, whatever you'd like to improve upon! Want to be the next great defender? Then focus on shot blocking and stealing. Want to be a freak athlete? Develop your physical characteristics like jumping and quickness. The path you choose is completely your own and open in the SBA. Think of this as a true Sports RPG experience!

&amp;#x200B;

I created this spreadsheet for fun, these are not created by a company like ESPN or by an expert like KenPom. I am no expert in NCAAB, but I LOVE statistics.

These rankings are based off of statistics retrieved from [teamrankings.com](https://teamrankings.com), also incorporating their own ranking system. Team Rankings has the most accurate rankings out of any of the big websites in my opinion, so this is why I chose them. 

The statistics used are based off of the 4 Factors of Basketball: Scoring, Rebounding, Turnovers, and Free Throws. Instead of using the original stats (eFG%, REB%, TO%, FTA/FTM), I used True Shooting % and FTM/100 possessions and kept REB% and TO%. I performed regression tests in Excel and found that these 4 were a better fit for predicting wins than the original 4. I found the coefficients in the regression equation for each of the 8 stats, 4 stats for offense and 4 stats on the defensive end. (Ex: offensive rebounding% and defensive rebounding%). I applied weights calculated in the equation to each teams ranking in the country of each factor. The higher the score, the better the team.

I added Team Ranking's predictive rankings in so that it would eliminate highly unlikely upsets, like a lower team beating a top 3 team in the nation. Some teams have great stats but do not play as hard of opponents as say, Duke. Team Ranking's predictive rankings offsets this unequal situation.

Enjoy!!

There are a lot of teams in regions that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example, how are Cal State Fullerton and UCLA in the East? Why are North Carolina, Florida State, Ohio State, UNC Greensboro, Providence (RI), and Lipscomb (TN) in the West? The Midwest must be defined by the entire continent given that Clemson (SC), NC State, Charleston (SC), Bucknell (PA), Duke (NC), Seton Hall (NJ), UPenn, Rhode Island, Syracuse (NY), Iona (NY), New Mexico State, and Arizona State are all in the Midwest Region. To complete the list, the South includes dumb selections like Buffalo (NY), Loyola Chicago, and UMBC (MD).

******

## My Suggestion

Below is what I feel would be the best way to put the 68 teams in the 4 regions. The format is the same as the real bracket. The East has 18 teams (two First Four games), South has 16 teams, Midwest has 17 teams (one First Four game), and West has 17 teams (one First Four game).
While it isn't 100% flawless, it uses common sense. 


Please note that I have not seeded or ranked the teams, just re grouped the regions logically

About a year ago around Selection Sunday I decided that it would be interesting to do a statistical modeling project to see if it is possible to predict the outcomes of March Madness games with reasonable success.

I’ve been able to scrape 11 years worth of data in over 80 statistical categories for all March Madness teams off of a website. This is equivalent to over 350,000 data points. I am currently working on transforming it into a workable format.

My next step is to fit a multiple linear model to it. This will help me see which stats have predictive value as to how far a team goes in March Madness.

Then, I will fit another model using only the statistically significant numbers and test it on last year’s bracket to assess its performance.

Hopefully, I will get this done tomorrow and have a write up of the findings posted by Wednesday for you guys to use however you want.

Some of the features include:
- Bracket generation: custom, random, or weighted towards favourites
- Real-time dollar value estimates of each bracket as the tournament progresses. 
- Group-bracket (ie. easily see who chose which teams without having to click on each bracket)
- Game-guide (ie. which game has the biggest impact on your bracket)
- Predictive scenario generator (ie. generates hypothetical standings based on inputted wins/losses)

My website is entirely just a hobby of mine with no ads or payments, just something I want to share. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions, I’m always happy to help and improve.

The foreign insect decimating wetlands in the lower Mississippi River Delta has spread much wider than scientists thought. It's now been found in at least 11 parishes on the Louisiana coast and around Lake Ponchartrain. 

A survey by the LSU AgCenter has confirmed that the Asian insect, known as a scale or mealy bug, has moved far beyond Plaquemines Parish, where it has affected more than 200,000 acres of roseau cane, a tall-growing grass that's critically important for marsh stability and wildlife habitat. In Plaquemines, high concentrations of the insect have converted marshes into open water in a matter of months. The scale appears to attack only roseau, but there are concerns it might begin feasting on sugar cane, sorghum and other south Louisiana crops. 

""The sugar cane people are really concerned,"" said Rodrigo Diaz, an AgCenter scientist leading Louisiana's response to the scale outbreak. ""It has not been found on sugar cane, but we're doing [experiments] that should tell us in two months whether they'll attack it or not. Right now, there's no reason to panic.""

The scale is the latest threat to Louisiana's coast, which has been receding for decades because of the leveeing of the Mississippi River, natural subsidence, hurricanes, sea level rise and oil and gas exploration and production.

In June, the scale had been confirmed in just three parishes: Plaquemines, Lafourche and Jefferson, and in the latter only at Grand Isle and Jean Lafitte. Then the AgCenter launched an online survey letting scientists and staff from parish and state agencies report suspected scale sightings. Survey participants sent in photos that AgCenter scientists used to identify the scale, greatly broadening the AgCenter's efforts to determine the scale's spread. 

As of July 18, the scale had been confirmed in all six parishes surrounding Lake Ponchartrain, including Orleans. And it has moved into St. Bernard Parish, with a concentration of reports near Poydras.

Beyond Plaquemines, the highest number of confirmed reports was in Jefferson Parish, with Jean Lafitte National Historical Park's Barataria Preserve and the town of Jean Lafitte especially hard-hit. Farther west, there was one report each in Terrebonne and St. Mary parishes, and three in Vermillion Parish.

Terrebonne might have more scale present, but the parish's vast marshes are difficult for survey respondents to access, Diaz said. Most of the survey's reports came from roseau stands on roadsides and other easy-to-access areas. 

There was one confirmed report outside Louisiana, near Bay St. Louis, Miss. 

Each confirmed report does not indicate a marsh die-off or large concentrations of the insect, only that the scale was present on roseau. 

The scale was first reported in south Plaquemines late last year. But it might have been in Louisiana much longer. 

""It's probably been here a couple of years, but we weren't looking for it,"" Diaz said. ""Now we're looking for it, and so it's easy find."" It appears to have enjoyed a recent population boom, possibly due to seasonal or weather-related factors that scientists are still examining. 

The scale's identity was a mystery for months. In April, after weeks of consultations with scientists from around the world, the scale was identified as nipponacerda biwakoensis, a type native to the cool marsh regions of China and Japan. It's unclear how the scale arrived in Louisiana, but it appears to thrive in its new surroundings. 

The AgCenter has drafted a two-year research plan aimed at stopping the insect's spread. The $378,000 plan has about half its funding. State agencies that have been asked to back the plan have said they have little or no money to contribute. 

The federal government appears poised to get involved. Last week, members of Congress backed a provision directing federal agencies to help develop a plan for eradicating the scale. The provision is unfunded, but it could bring more attention to the problem.

&lt;p&gt;The foreign insect decimating wetlands in the lower Mississippi River Delta has spread much wider than scientists thought. It&amp;#39;s now been found in at least 11 parishes on the Louisiana coast and around Lake Ponchartrain. &lt;/p&gt;

March is a crazy month because millions of people tune in to catch these nationally televised basketball games, while none of the revenue goes to the players. Billions of dollars, but they can't spare any for the student-athletes. They allow the players to become legends on the court because at the end of the day, it's not their court. It doesn't belong to them. The same way that money doesn't belong to them, they say. 

The athletes can't sell their own autographs, they can't do commercials without the school's consent, and they can't make money in any way while representing that school, that team. Before, after, or during March, the media is off-limits. Only the fleeting fame of an ESPN highlight, maybe a replay of the game five years from now if it was a helluva contest. But unlike other forms of fame, this type does not come attached to cash. Some players are able to tolerate this easier than others because they know they'll be moving on to the NBA. But a great deal won't. A vast majority will move on to a less public job with a much punier salary. They receive no royalties, no funds at all from the games, not even a check or a week off.

We shouted out the best things ever, loosely grouped them into four seasons for the bracket. We carefully spread out things like music, which is how something ridiculous like Indie/EDM snuck in to the play-in game, but rock didn’t make it. We regret these things.

Anyways, we ranked them individually, made up a totally legit scoring system, averaged the picks, and assigned seeds. That RAW DATA is attached.

My dad does a huge March Madness pool every year, and three years ago we decided to make a Euro bracket for the pool.  Europeans, who know nothing about college basketball, pick their winners for the bracket based solely on team mascots.  This is this years' bracket.  Pretty hilarious.  

The Euro Bracket Breakdown 2015 Wrap-up:


What is the Euro Bracket?:  Every year we (Bill and Kris) asked our European friends who have absolutely no knowledge of college basketball to pick a March Madness bracket.  Instead of explaining the background, dynasties, and strengths of each team we just come up with silly ways to have them pick.  This year we had them pick teams solely based on what each teams mascot looked like.


The Process: The best and most adorable images of college team mascots Google had to offer were put head to head on a powerpoint slide to decide which team was superior.  Team names were blocked out to prevent potential biases.  Other biases from the image collectors (Bill and Kris) may have happened.


The Judges: Three incredibly well educated engineers who could give great in depth analysis on the current state of the world energy markets and provide you with the well formed opinions on the future of electricity and what to do about climate change.  They also were found to enjoy Sesame Street, hot guys, cuddly non-cat based creature and ties (more on that in a minute).


Notable Decisions – Round 1:  
1)	Right off the bat, the presumptive tournament favourite (that’s right this is British English) and previous champ Kentucky is knocked out of the running mainly due to a sad mascot face and a bad sweatpant/jersey combination.  Accusations of image tampering by a vocal anti-Kentucky Childers family member are under investigation but currently unfounded.  

2)	The judges quickly become bored with the sheer amount of cat based mascots and find fuzzy nice looking creatures to be preferred. As a result, Buffalo, Texas and KU advance easily from the midwest bracket.

3)	In west bracket really strong showings from the “Adorable Duck” (Oregon) and the “Cookie Monster” or Biscuit Lord translated from Spanish (Xavier) lead the field with a slight upset happening from the cute goat with baby blue horns (UNC).  It is possible the alleged bias of the google searchers may have backfired….

4)	In the East bracket three juggernauts emerge in the fighting Tomatoes (Louisanna Lafayette), the cute horse (Oklahoma) and the puppy (Georgia) 

5)	In the south bracket another huge upset happens as the Duke Blue Devils) are toppled by simply the text “MYSTERY ?? ?!?!?!?!” because the Blue Devil looks mean.  The hot guy from SDSU makes a strong showing (Aztecs), but the tournament favourite clearly emerges from the first round as the super super cute crocodile, actually a dragon but whatever (UAB)
Notable Decisions – Round 2: 
1)	In the midwest, my beloved Bearcats advance, not at all because of my google searching bias.  All other fluffy teams advance.

2)	In the west, the Oregon cute duck, UNC goat and XU cookie monster all easily advance but sole adorable cat themed mascot of Texas Southern is making some noise, one to watch.

3)	In the east, the Layfayette Tomatoes, Oklahoma cute horse and UGA cute dog all cruise.  The anteaters of UC Irvine also squeak by the fighting nuns of Providence.

4)	In the south, the SDSU hot guy and the UAB cute crocodile assert their dominance with Swoop the University of Utah making waves.

Notable Decisions – Sweet 16:
1)	In the Midwest, the Bearcats fall because the Buffalo “is a really good shade of Blue” and has a sweet nose ring.  Texas advances too because we all went to a conference at UT last year and the three judges really liked the BBQ.

2)	In the West, the Orgeon Duck edges out the UNC cute ram because of his little round hat, the XU cookie monster was chosen unanimously after 1.5 seconds of deliberation.

3)	In the East, the Lafayette Tomato continues to crush opponents and the Oklahoma cute horse squeaks past UGA VII because he has nice blue eyes.

4)	In the South, the SDSU hot guy and the UAB croc continue to roll.

Notable Decisions – Elite 8:
1)	In the Midwest, it’s a lopsided victory for the longhorn, all hail Texas BBQ.

2)	In the West, the XU cookie monster gets past green Daffy duck.  It looked close on paper, but the fighting cookies didn’t break much of a sweat.

3)	In the East it was a bloodbath between the fighting tomatoes and the cute horse.  Oklahoma got the nod after much discussion due to its really cool parted hair and the fact that a cute cheerleader was in the background of the mascot picture (a comment from our only esteemed male judge).

4)	In the South, the SDSU hot guy’s Cinderella run ended because the UAB crocodile’s cuteness couldn’t be toppled.  Perfect shade of green, super friendly, super cuddly, a serious combination.

Notable Decisions – Final 4:
1)	Memories of brisket and slow cooked ribs can only get you so far.  Have you seen Sesame Street?  Cookie monster is the Lebron James of Sesame Street.  Game XU.

2)	The show down between Oklahoma and UAB took a little bit more time.  The group was in a deadlock, eventually all judges conceded that the crocodile could just eat the horse.

The Finals: 
1)	The anticipation mounted as the final slide was made with the two fluffy titans of college basketball squaring off.  When faced with these kinds of critical decisions, between the Xavier University blue fluffy and friendly cookie monster and the University of Alabama Birmingham plush green crocodile that is actually probably a dragon, you learn something about the judges.  You learn their thoughts on foot wear (cookie monster has colour coordinated footwear, which is a plus), on anatomy (the UAB croc/dragon’s really long tongue wasn’t seen as unusual), but most importantly you learn a lot about their deep down thoughts on sports competitions.  As this is the Euro Bracket and these are European judges, the outcome was the one preferred by many European sporting fans watching two teams they respect…. a tie.  Seriously, I tried to get them to come up with a clear winner and they didn’t really want to do it, “can’t it be both?”.  I tried to enter both into the sports bracket, but with no success.  “Its like Highlander,” I say, “there can only be one.”  They don’t get the reference.  It’s okay, the judges are happy with their decision.  Without further ado, your Euro bracket champions (by coin flip) are the University of Alabama-Birmingham cute crocodiles which are really dragons and are actually called the Blazers.

That concludes Euro Bracket 2015, I hope all of you will have better brackets than this one or suffer endless ridicule.  See you all next year!

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband and I are Americans who moved to Scotland 6 years ago.  My dad does a huge March Madness pool every year, and three years ago we decided to make a Euro bracket for the pool.  Europeans, who know nothing about college basketball, pick their winners for the bracket based solely on team mascots.  This is this years&amp;#39; bracket.  Pretty hilarious.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Euro Bracket Breakdown 2015 Wrap-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the Euro Bracket?:  Every year we (Bill and Kris) asked our European friends who have absolutely no knowledge of college basketball to pick a March Madness bracket.  Instead of explaining the background, dynasties, and strengths of each team we just come up with silly ways to have them pick.  This year we had them pick teams solely based on what each teams mascot looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Process: The best and most adorable images of college team mascots Google had to offer were put head to head on a powerpoint slide to decide which team was superior.  Team names were blocked out to prevent potential biases.  Other biases from the image collectors (Bill and Kris) may have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Judges: Three incredibly well educated engineers who could give great in depth analysis on the current state of the world energy markets and provide you with the well formed opinions on the future of electricity and what to do about climate change.  They also were found to enjoy Sesame Street, hot guys, cuddly non-cat based creature and ties (more on that in a minute).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Decisions – Round 1:&lt;br/&gt;
1)  Right off the bat, the presumptive tournament favourite (that’s right this is British English) and previous champ Kentucky is knocked out of the running mainly due to a sad mascot face and a bad sweatpant/jersey combination.  Accusations of image tampering by a vocal anti-Kentucky Childers family member are under investigation but currently unfounded.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  The judges quickly become bored with the sheer amount of cat based mascots and find fuzzy nice looking creatures to be preferred. As a result, Buffalo, Texas and KU advance easily from the midwest bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  In west bracket really strong showings from the “Adorable Duck” (Oregon) and the “Cookie Monster” or Biscuit Lord translated from Spanish (Xavier) lead the field with a slight upset happening from the cute goat with baby blue horns (UNC).  It is possible the alleged bias of the google searchers may have backfired….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)  In the East bracket three juggernauts emerge in the fighting Tomatoes (Louisanna Lafayette), the cute horse (Oklahoma) and the puppy (Georgia) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5)  In the south bracket another huge upset happens as the Duke Blue Devils) are toppled by simply the text “MYSTERY ?? ?!?!?!?!” because the Blue Devil looks mean.  The hot guy from SDSU makes a strong showing (Aztecs), but the tournament favourite clearly emerges from the first round as the super super cute crocodile, actually a dragon but whatever (UAB)
Notable Decisions – Round 2: 
1)  In the midwest, my beloved Bearcats advance, not at all because of my google searching bias.  All other fluffy teams advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  In the west, the Oregon cute duck, UNC goat and XU cookie monster all easily advance but sole adorable cat themed mascot of Texas Southern is making some noise, one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  In the east, the Layfayette Tomatoes, Oklahoma cute horse and UGA cute dog all cruise.  The anteaters of UC Irvine also squeak by the fighting nuns of Providence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)  In the south, the SDSU hot guy and the UAB cute crocodile assert their dominance with Swoop the University of Utah making waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Decisions – Sweet 16:
1)  In the Midwest, the Bearcats fall because the Buffalo “is a really good shade of Blue” and has a sweet nose ring.  Texas advances too because we all went to a conference at UT last year and the three judges really liked the BBQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  In the West, the Orgeon Duck edges out the UNC cute ram because of his little round hat, the XU cookie monster was chosen unanimously after 1.5 seconds of deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  In the East, the Lafayette Tomato continues to crush opponents and the Oklahoma cute horse squeaks past UGA VII because he has nice blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)  In the South, the SDSU hot guy and the UAB croc continue to roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Decisions – Elite 8:
1)  In the Midwest, it’s a lopsided victory for the longhorn, all hail Texas BBQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  In the West, the XU cookie monster gets past green Daffy duck.  It looked close on paper, but the fighting cookies didn’t break much of a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  In the East it was a bloodbath between the fighting tomatoes and the cute horse.  Oklahoma got the nod after much discussion due to its really cool parted hair and the fact that a cute cheerleader was in the background of the mascot picture (a comment from our only esteemed male judge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)  In the South, the SDSU hot guy’s Cinderella run ended because the UAB crocodile’s cuteness couldn’t be toppled.  Perfect shade of green, super friendly, super cuddly, a serious combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Decisions – Final 4:
1)  Memories of brisket and slow cooked ribs can only get you so far.  Have you seen Sesame Street?  Cookie monster is the Lebron James of Sesame Street.  Game XU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)  The show down between Oklahoma and UAB took a little bit more time.  The group was in a deadlock, eventually all judges conceded that the crocodile could just eat the horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Finals: 
1)  The anticipation mounted as the final slide was made with the two fluffy titans of college basketball squaring off.  When faced with these kinds of critical decisions, between the Xavier University blue fluffy and friendly cookie monster and the University of Alabama Birmingham plush green crocodile that is actually probably a dragon, you learn something about the judges.  You learn their thoughts on foot wear (cookie monster has colour coordinated footwear, which is a plus), on anatomy (the UAB croc/dragon’s really long tongue wasn’t seen as unusual), but most importantly you learn a lot about their deep down thoughts on sports competitions.  As this is the Euro Bracket and these are European judges, the outcome was the one preferred by many European sporting fans watching two teams they respect…. a tie.  Seriously, I tried to get them to come up with a clear winner and they didn’t really want to do it, “can’t it be both?”.  I tried to enter both into the sports bracket, but with no success.  “Its like Highlander,” I say, “there can only be one.”  They don’t get the reference.  It’s okay, the judges are happy with their decision.  Without further ado, your Euro bracket champions (by coin flip) are the University of Alabama-Birmingham cute crocodiles which are really dragons and are actually called the Blazers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That concludes Euro Bracket 2015, I hope all of you will have better brackets than this one or suffer endless ridicule.  See you all next year!&lt;/p&gt;

Setting game strategies

Some of the biggest new additions to the game this year are international recruits, recruiting pipelines, customizable recruiting difficulty, new conference alignments, improvements and changes in recruiting tactics, improved game AI, the ability to select and pursue a “dream job” and a brand new, rebuilt from the ground up UI which not only enhances the look of the game but also improves navigation while offering even more data to view than before.

GM Games will be following up on the release of the game with our take. But it is fair enough to say that this release has set the bar for available College Basketball simulation video games.
