We are celebrating our SEVENTH consecutive year of making everybody as angry as possible.

Seven years ago, /u/naaahhman created this project and for the last six I've held the line against the gamblers seeking to steal these rankings. Alongside a diligent team, past and present, there's no way anyone could ever fix the World Series...or understand our method. Coincidentally, we are the longest running r/baseball project.

If this is your first ballroom dance, we employ 30 voters (internet? accounts) taken from each fandom / team subreddit.  No one person has more influence than another -- especially Shoeless Joe and John Cusack -- and the fact that I'm a [](/SFG)Giants fan has no influence over the final rankings.

You will normally see this feature published on Monday between Noon and 2 PM Pacific--so, we'll meet again next Monday, April 8th.

Every voter has their own style / system and the only voting instructions are these:

*""To an extent determined individually, you must take into account how strong a team is right now and likely to be going forward. You must, to some degree, give weight to the events and games of the previous week.""*

However, given the lack of data, voters were asked to treat this as a **Preseason Vote** unless they personally found compelling reasons to alter their pre-Opening Day notions of each team.

**Thank you to all voters who have left this project -- your work has been incredibly appreciated. Those who have moved on will be acknowledged in a special way.**

And if I have my way, we'll be forcibly introducing y'all to the newer voters on the team.

_____________________________________________________

**TRANSPARENCY**: [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPERy28jzCm-WukH6TodvFj6Y-mIYzMAdtT3dcC7e9o/edit?usp=sharing) will show you who voted each team where and has added neat statistics!



______________________________________________________________


If something is a little messed up, just chalk it up to general rustiness but feel free to ~~pester me~~ let me know.

Total Votes: **29** of 30. So close.

The **delta change** somewhat irrelevantly refers to the last Power Ranking of the 2018 season for funsies.

\#||Team|Δ|Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+6**|  |**3 -1**
**2**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+15**| The 2019 Phillies lineup has transformed into a powerhouse; four of the top 5 spots have been reinvigorated with new talent, headlined by Phillies new savior Bryce Harper, replacing with 6-8 with the productive players of the past, including Franco who had two HRs and knocking in 7 of the 23 runs vs the Braves. The pressure will be on the pitching staff this year; if Velasquez and Eflin could be serviceable back-end SPs, the bullpen remains healthy and the new infield defense isn't as bad as last year, the team might be the team to beat in an already tough NL East. |**3 - 0**
**3**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-2**| The reigning champions are still at the top of my rankings because of how well they are coached, the strength of this team's defense, starting pitching, and offense. Although this was an offseason marked with multiple subtractions (Kimbrel, Joe Kelly, Ian Kinsler, Drew Pomeranz, and a Steven Wright suspension), and because of those sunbtractions, there are lots of question marks surrounding this bullpen, this is still the team to beat in the American League, National League, NPB, NJPW, Indigo Plateau, you name it, Sox is tops. |**1 - 3**
**4**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-2**| Michael Brantley has settled in nicely to his new home. Excited to have him on the team this year! We opened the season 1-3, so naturally, the season is over and Luhnow should sell everyone and everything. Including the god awful excuse for a chicken waffle cone they sell behind the first base dugout at MMP. We visit the Rangers this week, then finally have our home opener against the Athletics.  |**1 - 3**
**5**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-2**| Severino being lost to mystery shoulder injury puts quite the damper on the projections for the season, but still, the Yankees look to be a force to be reckoned with this season... which we proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by losing the first series of the season to the Orioles.  Real talk, though, people like Happ in the lineup plus the lack of a frontline ace and the amazing bullpen is going to make for a lot of tense comeback wins this season, and I'm pretty excited. |**1 -2 **
**6**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+3**| Little concern going into the season with 2/3 of the key bullpen pieces in various states of injured. So far, Yelich and Cain have shown that winning 1 run games is definitely sustainable  |**3 -1**
**7**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-2**| Baseball is back! I'm excited to do my fourth year of power rankings. While nothing will top the rush of my first season as the Cubs ranker, I'm anxiously awaiting the results of the 2019 season. The Cubs got off to a rough start. The bats were on fire, but the bullpen was disastrous and the starting pitching showed some weakness. However, 3 games is almost stastically meaningless. Reading into the standings at all right now would be laughable, so I barely considered opening weekend results in my rankings. |**1 -2**
**8**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+7**| With the Nats losing 2 of 3 against the Mets, there will be plenty of panic in DC. It's completely unwarranted because one loss was to deGrom. If Scherzer was able to beat deGrom, there would be a lot of chest-thumping going on in the nation's capital. NOTE: My rankings are based on ""what have you done"" vs ""what do I think you will do"" |**1 -2**
**9**|[](/CLE)|**Indians**|**-3**| The Tribe rolls into 2019 with the best rotation in baseball and only one real competitor in the Twins.  A division title seems likely, but will questions marks in the outfield and the bullpen be their Achilles heel? |**1 -2**
**10**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**+1**| cards probably should have finished sunday 2-2 but bad opening series are SOP for STL and that's conveniently ignoring that the brew crew is a good team that's probably still getting better. |**1 -3**
**11**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**-1**| The Rays enter 2019 with high hopes, but will the baseball gods' light shine upon them? The new compliments to Kiermaier have come out of the gate strong, and there is a glut of infield talent that runs deep into the farm. It's fun to note that the worst pitching performance thus far was the reigning Cy Young winner, and the bullpen has yet to allow a run. The temperature in the water is feeling just right to go full flap ahead. First series highlights include Yonny Chirinos going a strong 7 innings, Austin Meadows showing some muscle with 2HR, and Choi Boi antics in the field. Let's go Rays! |**3 -1**
**12**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**+7**| The Mets' offseason (the first under Brodie Van Wagenen) was ... a mixed-bag. Robinson Canó's contract seems to be a likely albatross, though he is looking OK for now. Edwin Díaz hopefully will be able to do well. While Kelenic was hyped, he was still an unproven prospect—plus, we got rid of Jay Bruce and Anthony Swarzak (sorry, Jay and Anthony, if you're reading). I don't understand the J. D. Davis trade at all—he is a fine organizational guy, but I don't see why we traded for him; hopefully he'll prove me wrong. Oh, and Bryce Harper is the most overrated player in baseball. |**2 -1**
**13**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**-9**| After going across the globe just to lose twice to the Mariners in a quasi-opening matchup, the A's opened the season at home against the Angels. Even though Trout did Trout things, we took two of three from them. Our starters have 24 straight scoreless innings, which is flabbergasting because we have a rotting pile of garbage as our current rotation. Don't even bother looking them up, I'm too embarrased. Needless to say, if Fiers and Estrada have a good April and May they'll be around, but we're just trying to escape. The bats are as alive as ever, Khris Davis is going to hit a billion home runs and we play the Red Sox this week at home.  |**3 - 3**
**14**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**-8**| Braves were absolutely brutalized by the Phillies. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Fingers crossed this isn't a sign of something. |**0 -3**
**15**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**-3**| Colorado's outlook for 2019 is more or less the exact same as it was for 2018. The rotation is great and the lineup is good enough, but there's not much depth and the team still has glaring holes. We're far from a playoff lock, but barring some serious injuries I fully expect to be in the mix come late September. Tl;dr fuck the Dodgers |**2 -2**
**16**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-3**| I had no idea what to expect coming into this season, but this certantly wasn't it. Mariners offense seems to be *almost* unstoppable. They've gone into the 9th with a lead or tied every game so far. The thing holding them back is easily the bullpen, although we'll see what Felix offers us tonight. Sign Kimbrel. |**5 -1**
**17**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+9**| Honestly wow. Here I was thinking that this would be another year of purgatory before the ball started rolling, but rockstar GM A.J. Prellar kicked us off early. Of course everyone is estatic that we locked up Manny for a minimum of five years, but we also got to see Tatis and Paddack on opening weekend, which is a sign from the organization that we aren't waiting around. Everything is pointing to the rebuild being over, and our climb to relevance just beginning. That being said, with the youth of the team needing to develop, and the lack of starting pitching depth, it would be hard for me to predict playoffs this year. I think we're in the 77-82 win range, which would still be a big improvement. We started off the seaon by taking 3/4 against the Giants, couldn't have asked for a better start. |**3 -1**
**18**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+2**| An encouraging Opening Weekend, going 2-1 against the Indians while being two wild pitches and a timely hit away from a sweep. With a solid rotation, a competent bullpen, impressive defense, and an explosive offense (when not facing top-10 pitchers), they look ready to challenge the Indians and turn the AL Central into a real horserace. Bright spots include Berrios pitching a gem, Buxton looking strong at the plate (4-for-10 with 3 doubles!), and our new additions already contributing. |**2 - 1**
**19**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-1**| If you ask what the strength of this Angels team is, I think the offense would be the answer by default, and only because of one guy. Mike Trout projects to account for more than a third of their position player value. Outside of him, it's difficult to find notable sources of contribution. Ohtani, Skaggs, and Upton - probably in that order - are interesting enough players, but betting on any of their health right now with basically one-and-a-half of them gone is not particularly prudent. It's a story that has become the norm for the better part of a decade for this team with the only changes being the cast. |**1 - 3**
**20**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+4**| This is technically my preseason blurb, so I'll table any Derek Dietrich overreactions that I have (and I have plenty.)  Maybe it was because I had to write 100 words on the team at the end of every week, but I was a little more optimistic after the Reds' 67-win 2018 than most. Sure, they won fewer games than the year before, but several players took clear steps in the right direction. And they followed that up with a tremendous offseason. After completely revamping their coaching staff, the Reds filled their biggest need by acquiring 3 capable starting pitchers without giving up any of their top 6 prospects, while also cutting ties with their two biggest negative contributors from the past couple seasons. I still can't believe they managed to get rid of Homer. All in all, the NL Central is going to be a bloodbath, but the Reds have what it takes to keep it interesting for a little while. |**1 - 1**
**21**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-5**| Pitching, pitching, pitching. The Pirates' 2019 season will go as far as the men on the mound can take them. In a tight NL Central race, the Bucs are projected by Fangraphs to have the best rotation and bullpen in the division. The question will be whether the Pirates can score any runs. The best hitter of the 2018 campaign, Gregory Polanco, is still recovering from shoulder surgery. Starling Marte and orey Dickerson are good, but each is over 30 and getting older. The Pirates will need big seasons from guys like Adam Frazier, Josh Bell and Jung-ho Kang or there will be a lot of frustraitng, low scoring losses. |**1 - 1**
**22**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**0**| The Blue Jays Starting Pitchers opened the season going 24 innings without giving up a run. The best since the '94 Barves. Sure, it was against the Tigers, and sure, they still split the series. But promising appearances from Trent Thornton and the first ever appearance by a player born in the 21st century, Elvis Luciano, prove that there are plenty of reasons to watch this team. And that's without a certain ""injured"" consenus #1 prospect. |**2 - 2**
**23**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**-9**| The D-backs were deservingly punished by the baseball gods in their opening series at the Dodgers. The offense, led by Christin Walker, looks better thn advertised, but the pitching has been a dumpster fire inside of a burning building on the sun |**1 - 3**
**24**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**-1**| D.R.E.A.M. Dingers Rule Everything Around Me. |**2 - 1**
**25**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-4**| Well you can't say that the team doesn't look different in the Farhan Zaidi era. The unofficial official rebuild begins this year, not with a bang, but with a whimper, as we have the likes of Connor Joe, Michael Reed, and Yangervis Solarte in the everyday lineup. Who the hell are Connor Joe and Michael Reed? Who the hell cares? Last year we had delusions of grandeur of competing, this year we have delusions of grandeur of being able to out-tank the Orioles and Tigers for that sweet sweet #1 overall pick in 2020. If the 2019 Giants win more than 65 games, I'll be shocked. |**1 - 3**
**26**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**+3**| Holy Aesop, Kyle Zimmer exists!!! All sarcasm aside, it was great to see him finally make his long awaited major league debut and to notch his first strikeout. Hopefully, this is the first of many, and Zimmer can become a key member of the Royals bullpen for years to come. |**2 - 1**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**Black Sox**|**0**| If the White Sox are going to float this sinking ship, it needs to start, like, right now. Giolito and Moncada looking like world beaters VERY early is a start |**1 - 2**
**28**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-3**| One weekend in and we've already had a big scare: Miguel got hit by a pitch on his hand. It appears things went alright (he DH'd and hit two balls to the warning track the next day), but if he goes down again for a long period of time, the Tigers will be challenging the Orioles for the worst record in the Bigs. This will certainly be a trying type of year, with plenty of spots to be had for players that would like to step up. Next week: 3 at NYY, 3 vs. KCR. |**2 - 2**
**29**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**-1**| Were in year 2 of Jeters rebuild, so the Fish are gonna lose around 100 games. Pitching will likely be stronger this year given the raw talent on the rotation (Urena, Richards, Lopez, Alcantara and Smith) and depth in the minors. The potential to have a top 10 rotation in the league within the next couple years is a very real possibility. Counterpoint: the offense will likely remain inconsistent until more talent comes up from the minors. TLDR: marlins will struggle to not lose 100 games and will start building on a very solid foundation of young players. 2021 WS champs you heard it here first! |**2 - 2**
**30**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**0**| This is my first time doing this and my rankings will change throughout, one thing I can guarantee is my favorite team the Orioles will probably stay at the bottom.  That makes it a tad easier lol. |**2 -1 **
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the 1919 &lt;a href=""/r/baseball""&gt;r/baseball&lt;/a&gt; Power Ranking season!  We are celebrating our SEVENTH consecutive year of making everybody as angry as possible.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, &lt;a href=""/u/naaahhman""&gt;/u/naaahhman&lt;/a&gt; created this project and for the last six I&amp;#39;ve held the line against the gamblers seeking to steal these rankings. Alongside a diligent team, past and present, there&amp;#39;s no way anyone could ever fix the World Series...or understand our method. Coincidentally, we are the longest running &lt;a href=""/r/baseball""&gt;r/baseball&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is your first ballroom dance, we employ 30 voters (internet? accounts) taken from each fandom / team subreddit.  No one person has more influence than another -- especially Shoeless Joe and John Cusack -- and the fact that I&amp;#39;m a &lt;a href=""/SFG""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Giants fan has no influence over the final rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will normally see this feature published on Monday between Noon and 2 PM Pacific--so, we&amp;#39;ll meet again next Monday, April 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every voter has their own style / system and the only voting instructions are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;To an extent determined individually, you must take into account how strong a team is right now and likely to be going forward. You must, to some degree, give weight to the events and games of the previous week.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given the lack of data, voters were asked to treat this as a &lt;strong&gt;Preseason Vote&lt;/strong&gt; unless they personally found compelling reasons to alter their pre-Opening Day notions of each team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you to all voters who have left this project -- your work has been incredibly appreciated. Those who have moved on will be acknowledged in a special way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if I have my way, we&amp;#39;ll be forcibly introducing y&amp;#39;all to the newer voters on the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRANSPARENCY&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPERy28jzCm-WukH6TodvFj6Y-mIYzMAdtT3dcC7e9o/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; will show you who voted each team where and has added neat statistics!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If something is a little messed up, just chalk it up to general rustiness but feel free to &lt;del&gt;pester me&lt;/del&gt; let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Votes: &lt;strong&gt;29&lt;/strong&gt; of 30. So close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;delta change&lt;/strong&gt; somewhat irrelevantly refers to the last Power Ranking of the 2018 season for funsies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;The 2019 Phillies lineup has transformed into a powerhouse; four of the top 5 spots have been reinvigorated with new talent, headlined by Phillies new savior Bryce Harper, replacing with 6-8 with the productive players of the past, including Franco who had two HRs and knocking in 7 of the 23 runs vs the Braves. The pressure will be on the pitching staff this year; if Velasquez and Eflin could be serviceable back-end SPs, the bullpen remains healthy and the new infield defense isn&amp;#39;t as bad as last year, the team might be the team to beat in an already tough NL East.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 - 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/BOS""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Sox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;The reigning champions are still at the top of my rankings because of how well they are coached, the strength of this team&amp;#39;s defense, starting pitching, and offense. Although this was an offseason marked with multiple subtractions (Kimbrel, Joe Kelly, Ian Kinsler, Drew Pomeranz, and a Steven Wright suspension), and because of those sunbtractions, there are lots of question marks surrounding this bullpen, this is still the team to beat in the American League, National League, NPB, NJPW, Indigo Plateau, you name it, Sox is tops.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Michael Brantley has settled in nicely to his new home. Excited to have him on the team this year! We opened the season 1-3, so naturally, the season is over and Luhnow should sell everyone and everything. Including the god awful excuse for a chicken waffle cone they sell behind the first base dugout at MMP. We visit the Rangers this week, then finally have our home opener against the Athletics.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/NYY""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yankees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Severino being lost to mystery shoulder injury puts quite the damper on the projections for the season, but still, the Yankees look to be a force to be reckoned with this season... which we proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by losing the first series of the season to the Orioles.  Real talk, though, people like Happ in the lineup plus the lack of a frontline ace and the amazing bullpen is going to make for a lot of tense comeback wins this season, and I&amp;#39;m pretty excited.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;*&lt;em&gt;1 -2 *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/MIL""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Little concern going into the season with 2/3 of the key bullpen pieces in various states of injured. So far, Yelich and Cain have shown that winning 1 run games is definitely sustainable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/CHC1""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cubs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Baseball is back! I&amp;#39;m excited to do my fourth year of power rankings. While nothing will top the rush of my first season as the Cubs ranker, I&amp;#39;m anxiously awaiting the results of the 2019 season. The Cubs got off to a rough start. The bats were on fire, but the bullpen was disastrous and the starting pitching showed some weakness. However, 3 games is almost stastically meaningless. Reading into the standings at all right now would be laughable, so I barely considered opening weekend results in my rankings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/WSH""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nationals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;With the Nats losing 2 of 3 against the Mets, there will be plenty of panic in DC. It&amp;#39;s completely unwarranted because one loss was to deGrom. If Scherzer was able to beat deGrom, there would be a lot of chest-thumping going on in the nation&amp;#39;s capital. NOTE: My rankings are based on &amp;quot;what have you done&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;what do I think you will do&amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/CLE""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;The Tribe rolls into 2019 with the best rotation in baseball and only one real competitor in the Twins.  A division title seems likely, but will questions marks in the outfield and the bullpen be their Achilles heel?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/STL""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardinals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;cards probably should have finished sunday 2-2 but bad opening series are SOP for STL and that&amp;#39;s conveniently ignoring that the brew crew is a good team that&amp;#39;s probably still getting better.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 -3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/TB""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;The Rays enter 2019 with high hopes, but will the baseball gods&amp;#39; light shine upon them? The new compliments to Kiermaier have come out of the gate strong, and there is a glut of infield talent that runs deep into the farm. It&amp;#39;s fun to note that the worst pitching performance thus far was the reigning Cy Young winner, and the bullpen has yet to allow a run. The temperature in the water is feeling just right to go full flap ahead. First series highlights include Yonny Chirinos going a strong 7 innings, Austin Meadows showing some muscle with 2HR, and Choi Boi antics in the field. Let&amp;#39;s go Rays!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/NYM""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;The Mets&amp;#39; offseason (the first under Brodie Van Wagenen) was ... a mixed-bag. Robinson Canó&amp;#39;s contract seems to be a likely albatross, though he is looking OK for now. Edwin Díaz hopefully will be able to do well. While Kelenic was hyped, he was still an unproven prospect—plus, we got rid of Jay Bruce and Anthony Swarzak (sorry, Jay and Anthony, if you&amp;#39;re reading). I don&amp;#39;t understand the J. D. Davis trade at all—he is a fine organizational guy, but I don&amp;#39;t see why we traded for him; hopefully he&amp;#39;ll prove me wrong. Oh, and Bryce Harper is the most overrated player in baseball.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/OAK""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Athletics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;After going across the globe just to lose twice to the Mariners in a quasi-opening matchup, the A&amp;#39;s opened the season at home against the Angels. Even though Trout did Trout things, we took two of three from them. Our starters have 24 straight scoreless innings, which is flabbergasting because we have a rotting pile of garbage as our current rotation. Don&amp;#39;t even bother looking them up, I&amp;#39;m too embarrased. Needless to say, if Fiers and Estrada have a good April and May they&amp;#39;ll be around, but we&amp;#39;re just trying to escape. The bats are as alive as ever, Khris Davis is going to hit a billion home runs and we play the Red Sox this week at home.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/ATL""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Braves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Braves were absolutely brutalized by the Phillies. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Fingers crossed this isn&amp;#39;t a sign of something.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 -3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/COL""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rockies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Colorado&amp;#39;s outlook for 2019 is more or less the exact same as it was for 2018. The rotation is great and the lineup is good enough, but there&amp;#39;s not much depth and the team still has glaring holes. We&amp;#39;re far from a playoff lock, but barring some serious injuries I fully expect to be in the mix come late September. Tl;dr fuck the Dodgers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 -2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/SEA""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;I had no idea what to expect coming into this season, but this certantly wasn&amp;#39;t it. Mariners offense seems to be &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; unstoppable. They&amp;#39;ve gone into the 9th with a lead or tied every game so far. The thing holding them back is easily the bullpen, although we&amp;#39;ll see what Felix offers us tonight. Sign Kimbrel.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/SD""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Padres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Honestly wow. Here I was thinking that this would be another year of purgatory before the ball started rolling, but rockstar GM A.J. Prellar kicked us off early. Of course everyone is estatic that we locked up Manny for a minimum of five years, but we also got to see Tatis and Paddack on opening weekend, which is a sign from the organization that we aren&amp;#39;t waiting around. Everything is pointing to the rebuild being over, and our climb to relevance just beginning. That being said, with the youth of the team needing to develop, and the lack of starting pitching depth, it would be hard for me to predict playoffs this year. I think we&amp;#39;re in the 77-82 win range, which would still be a big improvement. We started off the seaon by taking 3/4 against the Giants, couldn&amp;#39;t have asked for a better start.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/MIN""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;An encouraging Opening Weekend, going 2-1 against the Indians while being two wild pitches and a timely hit away from a sweep. With a solid rotation, a competent bullpen, impressive defense, and an explosive offense (when not facing top-10 pitchers), they look ready to challenge the Indians and turn the AL Central into a real horserace. Bright spots include Berrios pitching a gem, Buxton looking strong at the plate (4-for-10 with 3 doubles!), and our new additions already contributing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/LAA""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;If you ask what the strength of this Angels team is, I think the offense would be the answer by default, and only because of one guy. Mike Trout projects to account for more than a third of their position player value. Outside of him, it&amp;#39;s difficult to find notable sources of contribution. Ohtani, Skaggs, and Upton - probably in that order - are interesting enough players, but betting on any of their health right now with basically one-and-a-half of them gone is not particularly prudent. It&amp;#39;s a story that has become the norm for the better part of a decade for this team with the only changes being the cast.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/CIN""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;This is technically my preseason blurb, so I&amp;#39;ll table any Derek Dietrich overreactions that I have (and I have plenty.)  Maybe it was because I had to write 100 words on the team at the end of every week, but I was a little more optimistic after the Reds&amp;#39; 67-win 2018 than most. Sure, they won fewer games than the year before, but several players took clear steps in the right direction. And they followed that up with a tremendous offseason. After completely revamping their coaching staff, the Reds filled their biggest need by acquiring 3 capable starting pitchers without giving up any of their top 6 prospects, while also cutting ties with their two biggest negative contributors from the past couple seasons. I still can&amp;#39;t believe they managed to get rid of Homer. All in all, the NL Central is going to be a bloodbath, but the Reds have what it takes to keep it interesting for a little while.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/PIT""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pirates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Pitching, pitching, pitching. The Pirates&amp;#39; 2019 season will go as far as the men on the mound can take them. In a tight NL Central race, the Bucs are projected by Fangraphs to have the best rotation and bullpen in the division. The question will be whether the Pirates can score any runs. The best hitter of the 2018 campaign, Gregory Polanco, is still recovering from shoulder surgery. Starling Marte and orey Dickerson are good, but each is over 30 and getting older. The Pirates will need big seasons from guys like Adam Frazier, Josh Bell and Jung-ho Kang or there will be a lot of frustraitng, low scoring losses.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/TOR""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Jays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;The Blue Jays Starting Pitchers opened the season going 24 innings without giving up a run. The best since the &amp;#39;94 Barves. Sure, it was against the Tigers, and sure, they still split the series. But promising appearances from Trent Thornton and the first ever appearance by a player born in the 21st century, Elvis Luciano, prove that there are plenty of reasons to watch this team. And that&amp;#39;s without a certain &amp;quot;injured&amp;quot; consenus #1 prospect.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;The D-backs were deservingly punished by the baseball gods in their opening series at the Dodgers. The offense, led by Christin Walker, looks better thn advertised, but the pitching has been a dumpster fire inside of a burning building on the sun&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Well you can&amp;#39;t say that the team doesn&amp;#39;t look different in the Farhan Zaidi era. The unofficial official rebuild begins this year, not with a bang, but with a whimper, as we have the likes of Connor Joe, Michael Reed, and Yangervis Solarte in the everyday lineup. Who the hell are Connor Joe and Michael Reed? Who the hell cares? Last year we had delusions of grandeur of competing, this year we have delusions of grandeur of being able to out-tank the Orioles and Tigers for that sweet sweet #1 overall pick in 2020. If the 2019 Giants win more than 65 games, I&amp;#39;ll be shocked.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/KCR""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Holy Aesop, Kyle Zimmer exists!!! All sarcasm aside, it was great to see him finally make his long awaited major league debut and to notch his first strikeout. Hopefully, this is the first of many, and Zimmer can become a key member of the Royals bullpen for years to come.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/CHW""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Sox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;If the White Sox are going to float this sinking ship, it needs to start, like, right now. Giolito and Moncada looking like world beaters VERY early is a start&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/DET""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tigers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;One weekend in and we&amp;#39;ve already had a big scare: Miguel got hit by a pitch on his hand. It appears things went alright (he DH&amp;#39;d and hit two balls to the warning track the next day), but if he goes down again for a long period of time, the Tigers will be challenging the Orioles for the worst record in the Bigs. This will certainly be a trying type of year, with plenty of spots to be had for players that would like to step up. Next week: 3 at NYY, 3 vs. KCR.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/MIA""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marlins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;Were in year 2 of Jeters rebuild, so the Fish are gonna lose around 100 games. Pitching will likely be stronger this year given the raw talent on the rotation (Urena, Richards, Lopez, Alcantara and Smith) and depth in the minors. The potential to have a top 10 rotation in the league within the next couple years is a very real possibility. Counterpoint: the offense will likely remain inconsistent until more talent comes up from the minors. TLDR: marlins will struggle to not lose 100 games and will start building on a very solid foundation of young players. 2021 WS champs you heard it here first!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;This is my first time doing this and my rankings will change throughout, one thing I can guarantee is my favorite team the Orioles will probably stay at the bottom.  That makes it a tad easier lol.&lt;/td&gt;

So it would cost **$420 extra per year** to be able to watch *just* the Mets and the Yankees for 6 months and then I would have to change my package.

So here was the best solution I found:

* Pay $116 for mlb.tv to watch all out-of-market games. I can stream out-of-market games directly on my streaming device.

* Pay for a VPN service (The one I'm using costs about $36 per year) so I can watch the Mets and Yankees as ""out-of-market"" teams.

* Stream Mets / Yankees games from my computer to my TV (I use Apple TV with Airplay)

* Once I get access to the Mets / Yankees games, I turn my VPN off so that the streaming quality is much better (VPN can make Internet connection poor). The workaround here is that if you START watching the game from another location, the game will keep playing even if it's a local market game and you're not using a VPN.

So in total, I am paying **$152 per year** to get access to *ALL* MLB games this year, including my local market teams. I have found this is the best possible solution.

I know some people just use r/MLBStreams, but I find the poor quality and extremely unreliable streams too frustrating.

Other benefits of this solution - you get access to all replays for the game action you missed watching live. Also, MLB app on the streaming devices has also gotten really good and is worth paying something for on its own IMO.

I did not inherit this predilection. 

So, as the Korean War was ramping up in 1952, my grandpa was attending the City College of New York and dating my grandmother, and decided to enlist in the Army for the benefits of the G.I. Bill. He ended up being trained and posted at Fort Eustis in Virginia for a year.

At the same time, Willie Mays, who had just completed his first season with the New York Giants in 1951, was drafted early in the 1952 season and was also stationed at Fort Eustis. The Army allowed its members (well, those who could afford it) to have cars on base, and so Willie, using some of the money from his rookie season, bought himself one, which he would use to drive up to New York.

At a certain point Willie would start charging guys $25 (about $260 now) to come with him on his trips to New York. At one point, he asked my grandpa if he wanted to go. Gee, a chance to go back to his hometown, see his family and his girlfriend, *and* drive with a great player from his favorite team?

Nah, he figured. Wasn't worth the cash. Good thinking, Gramps.

Mind you, this is the same guy who got a ball signed by Babe Ruth when he was a kid, and threw it out because Babe had been mean to him. He has regretted both instances ever since.

As a Rangers fan, here is my list:

Acquire:

1) Dallas Kuechel. We need pitching. I’m not really excited with our rotation, and he’s the best option right now. 

2) Craig Kimbrel. Again, we need pitching. Same as above but with the back end of our pen. 

3) Alex Verdugo. I love his hitting ability, and he plays the field well. I see him being able to play all three spots, due to his incredible arm, but as a lefty I don’t know. I think that when Choo leaves, and we see what happens with Gallo, we’ll need more outfielders. And lefty power is always welcomed

Get rid of:

1) Shin-Soo Choo. He makes too much money for his age and the fact that I see him as a DH. With a better contract he might not be on my list. 

2) Lance Lynn. I’d like to see him be a 4th or 5th starter not a 3rd, I want us to get better pitching, and with his contract, I don’t see him here for much longer. 

3) I pretty much like the rest of our roster right now so I don’t mind keeping the rest.

I like many things about it. However, I still haven’t found a true love for watching it.

That may change due to this site.  This site gives me the context and info that I need to make this sport interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------

**Example:**

Pitcher X strikes out Batter Y on a Slider, another slider, followed by a 4 seam fastball. Who cares?

Now, how about if I told you that no one has hit Pitcher X’s slider for the past 40 times he’s thrown it? So he kept his streak going and his slider is on fire.  That’s interesting.

And how about if I told you that Batter Y has been batting .550 against fast balls this month?  So, the pitcher used his slider to get up on Batter Y, and then threw a fastball at him, despite him being a great fastball hitter. Now that’s interesting.

The next batter comes up. He’s been hitting .300 on sliders this year. Now, is the pitcher going to use his super hot slider weapon to get up on the count again?  I’m interested to see.

\---------------------------------------------------------

I am baffled and highly disappointed that most broadcasters hardly ever bring any of this stuff up.  They mostly just give factual play-by-play.

They need to inform us about this more detailed stuff.

Maybe then baseball tv ratings and popularity will stop falling, as baseball is beautiful because of this detailed stuff.

Oakland A's owner Charlie O. Finley was part innovator, part showman, and all capitalist. There was no idea too outlandish for Charlie O. as long as it resulted in making money. ""All people are the same color to Charlie Finley,"" Reggie Jackson once said. ""Green."" 

&gt; When he first acquired the [Kansas City A's], Finley tried anything and everything to interest people in his team: cow-milking contests, greased-pig contests, a sheep pasture (with a shepherd) beyond right field, a zoo beyond left. He installed a mechanical rabbit named Harvey behind home plate to pop up and hand the umpire new baseballs. He had “Little Blowhard,” a compressed-air device inside of home plate that blew dirt away. He hired Miss U.S.A to be the batgirl. He installed a yellow cab to bring in pitchers from the bullpen. He released helium balloons with A’s tickets throughout the countryside. He installed lights in the dugout so that the fans could see the manager and players discussing strategy. He shot off fireworks in the park, but the neighbors complained and the city made him desist. Finley sued the city. 

Finley ultimately gave up on Kansas City and, after flirting with Dallas and Louisville, finally moved the team to Oakland, and there he really started to innovate: He paid players to grow mustaches; he convinced his 19-year-old pitcher Jim Hunter to call himself Catfish (and invented a story for him to tell about how he acquired the nickname as a boy); he signed a world record sprinter, who hadn't played baseball since high school, to be his [""designated runner""](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/washihe01.shtml); he replaced the ball boys with ball girls (and put them in [short shorts](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a8/9a/06/a89a06da0126a4ed543e54c7bc3b76a2.jpg)). 

His ideas weren't limited to the A's, though. He had big ideas about making baseball better, or at least, what *he* thought would be better. He led the charge for the Designated Hitter in the American League. He insisted the All-Star Game and weekday World Series games be played at night. He also pushed for interleague play, something that wouldn't happen until a year after his death. (He also wanted to speed up the game by having a walk on three balls and a strikeout on two strikes -- hopefully Rob Manfred isn't reading this.) 

But his ""brightest"" idea was to replace the white baseballs with orange ones, the thought being, as with traffic cones and hunter vests and life jackets, orange was easier to see. He ordered crates of the balls, custom-made by Spalding, in the hopes they would catch on with the public. 

(Thirty years earlier, Larry MacPhail -- who built great teams for the Reds, Dodgers, and Yankees -- had proposed orange balls be used in night games, but Charlie O. was never a man to give credit to anyone else.) 

Finally, on March 29, 1973, it happened. The powers-that-be agreed to use the orange balls in an exhibition game against the Indians. 

With Commissioner Bowie Kuhn in the stands, the two teams took the field, the umpires supplied with the Charlie O. orange balls. And they were orange -- [really orange](https://sports.ha.com/itm/baseball-collectibles/balls/1973-official-charles-o-finley-prototype-orange-baseball-with-original-box/a/151814-42122.s). 

Indians outfielder George Hendrick hit three of the balls over the fence for home runs in an 11-5 rout of the A's. Incredibly, Hendrick said after the game the orange balls were *harder* to see. (Imagine what kind of day he would have had if the balls were white!) The red seams on the orange horsehide were impossible to pick up, he said. 

The pitchers didn't like the balls either -- no surprise given that the two teams had combined for 16 runs. They said they were too slippery. 

With the batters complaining and the pitchers complaining, Charlie O.'s orange balls were squeezed out of existence. The balls were tried in one more game, and then never more.  

But there's more to the story. 

Dick Williams, the A's manager, said Hendrick -- who had been traded from the A's to the Indians just five days earlier for a perceived lack of hustle -- badmouthed the orange balls out of spite. ""I think he did that just to get back at Charlie,"" Williams said. ""Call it 'invention killed by a grudge.'""

Who knows. If Hendrick had sung the praises of the orange balls, maybe we'd be using them today. Yay for grudges!

It doesn’t display your photos with each game, doesn’t let you add old games you’ve attended, and doesn’t show highlights, box scores, and your notes from each attended game. The Journal feature was by far the most popular part of the app, and they totally destroyed it.

But I found out yesterday the problems continue. My son and I both have the app installed on our phones, but I had our tickets to Reds Opening Day only on my phone. When I entered the park, I was automatically “checked in”, but we could not find a way for my son to check in on his phone like in the past. I tried to transfer him one of the tickets, but I just got errors (perhaps because I already had used them?). Just this morning, I found his phone hadn’t updated to the latest version from four days ago, and that might be why there was no “check in” option. But really, MLB, you just added that feature four days before Opening Day!? And since he’s got no way to add past games, now he can’t add yesterday’s game to his “My History”.  
 
Then today I get an email from the Reds saying that I get free pizza because the Reds struck out 11 batters. Since my tickets were on the Ballpark app, they said I need to use that app to retrieve the offer, and gave directions how to do so. But the directions don’t work! They reference going to “your Journal” (which doesn’t exist anymore!), and even when I try under “My History” or anywhere else, there are no options to redeem my offer. Perhaps it’s in there, but I have no idea how to get it (and you can’t email them back, as the sending address doesn’t accept incoming emails).

I’ve been impressed for years with MLB’s advanced media and their apps. But this year’s Ballpark app is a huge black eye for them. Get it together, MLB.

[Update: I just got an email from the Reds with updated instructions on how to redeem my free pizza offer.

I was wondering what you all thought the best source was for downloading baseball data to csv/importing directly to R.

I am proud to announce that Batter Up is back for 2019 with new features and enhancements.

[Batter Up](https://mcmadbat.me/apps/batterup) lets you [create a list of players](https://imgur.com/a/mR6Kqfm) you want to follow, then it monitors live MLB games and sends you a [notification](https://imgur.com/a/YkfSx) when a player is about to come to bat or pitch. The notification includes a MLB.TV link so you are just one click from watching the player's appearance.   

This extension is great for people who are fans of players across the league and want to watch their appearances live as it is happening. 

For example, I am a big fan of Andrew Miller. But since he's a reliever it is hard to catch his appearances live. With Batter Up, I can watch my Blue Jays as normal, and if Miller is about to pitch in his games then I can easily switch over.  

New improvements since last season includes the scheduled game time and current game score. Now you have even more context to quickly decide if you want to switch over to a game for just his appearance.

Please check it out on the [Chrome Web Store](https://mcmadbat.me/apps/batterup). I hope that this extension helps augment your baseball viewing experience like it did for me last year. 

Thanks and have a great 2019 season!

Rotation order goes by the average number of innings pitched per start and is not necessarily a commentary on how good they were, or the rotation order teams actually went with.

What about best streaks?

I knew Willie Mays started in CF for the Giants for 19 years in a row (should have been 21 without Korean War). So I looked next if anyone beat that, weirdly enough, it was again the Orioles with from Brooks Robinson from 1957-1976.

Longest current streak? Unsurprisingly it goes to Yadi Molina with 15 years in a row!

&lt;p&gt;What about best streaks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew Willie Mays started in CF for the Giants for 19 years in a row (should have been 21 without Korean War). So I looked next if anyone beat that, weirdly enough, it was again the Orioles with from Brooks Robinson from 1957-1976.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longest current streak? Unsurprisingly it goes to Yadi Molina with 15 years in a row!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Opening Day!&lt;/p&gt;

In turn, he should pitch better and get better results despite not having Billy Hamilton in center.

Gray looks like getting away from the DH, Yankee stadium and the AL East will do him a tremendous amount of good. Not to mention that his college pitching coach from Vanderbilt university is no the Cincinnati Reds pitching coach. Expecting a big bounce back year even if he's going to another hitter friendly park.

DeSclafani looks like a solid starter if he can stay healthy who will have a better groundball rate, which should help his home run rate to go down in addition to a HR/FB rate at league average he should have a home run rate close to his career average. His strikeout rate will also likely go down unless his curveball improved, but I'd prefer him throwing more changeups instead.

Roark is an inning chewer who should have better results due to an increased groundball rate and a slightly lower Homer rate due to hr/fb increase and a more hitter friendly park.

Mahle is a confusing pitcher who should be a good spot starter/fill in even if he doesn't improve his secondary pitches like he should do.

Wood looks like a good starter, especially when he is healthy. He should have positive regression in his strikeout and groundball rates. Unfortunately, a walk rate, home run rate increase coupled with a weaker defense and more hitter friendly park will likely mean he'll be a mid to high 3 ERA pitcher.

Reed is a good pitcher who looks like he should be able to start if and when Wood and or Roark are traded. His groundball rate should regress towards 50% but he should be able to do better than Tanner Roark on a per inning basis. His results should not be effected as his hr/fb ratio will regress towards MLB average levels.

Romano is a guy who even if he improves his strikeout, groundball and home run rate I don't think should be in the rotation at the moment. Maybe after midseason trades he could get some starts.

Lopez is a prospect who is going to get some positive regression in K/BB rates and groundball rates.

PHI SP: Nola is nothing more than an ACE starting pitcher who had a CY YOUNG award worthy season last year. He should be able to do similarly and be a consistent CY YOUNG award contender for years to come.

Arrieta is a solid inning chewer who used to be much better than he is now. He should be able to get better strikeout rates to pitch better and having a better defense should only help even further.

Pivetta reminds me of Pineda and Ricky Nolasco back in the day. He'll get strikeouts, do good with walks and get some groundballs. He should be expected to do better thanks to a better defense which should lower his babip, also he should be expected to have a lower hr/fb rate.

Velasquez is a high octane starter who gets strikeouts and doesn't walk too many. His flyball tendencies put him below Pivetta even though they don't pitch long into the game.

Elfin is a solid starter who should be able to get the 5 starter spot over Eickhoff. He gets strikeouts and limits walks. Keep an eye on him.

De los Santos is not from GTA V but he's a perfectly good fill-in starter who is healthy unlike Eickhoff. If I know he's healthy, De los Santos would be below Eickhoff.

Eickhoff is a contender for the 5 spot. Good strikeout to walk rate with a lower groundball rate than that is safe for his home park. His previous inning chewer status was important and should be important for his value.

Anderson has a similar current value as De los Santos does, but his AA performance in 2017 was concerning and I am considering that in my depth chart along with his lower groundball rates.

Suarez is a depth starter who needs to get more strikeouts to be seriously worth looking at considering his walk rate is merely ok. To be honest, his groundball rate gives him a chance at any future starting pitcher role.

STL SP: Mikolas is a great inning chewer who has velocity and limits walks extremely well. He also can get strikeouts. He should be able to get more strikeouts this year with his stuff, albeit with a slightly higher walk rate.

Flaherty is a solid starter who is likely to improve his walk rate next year while continuing to get plenty of strikeouts, he's also going to benefit a little from generating a few more groundballs. He hasn't pitched a lot of innings per start, but he's plenty valuable as it is with his current profile.

Wacha should be a solid mid to back rotation guy depending on his health and consistency as his strikeout to walk rate is more good not great and it's plenty for his slightly above average groundball rate.

Wainwright is a better name than he is a pitcher at this point, but he should be an acceptable back end guy if he can stay healthy.

Hudson looks like an extreme groundball pitcher who has a high floor and lacking K/BB rates in AAA, I'm not exactly impressed by him but the Cardinals love him so we'll see. They're pretty good about pitchers, so I think I'll trust them on this one.

Gant should be a solid fill-in starter who can be a 5 starter, he should have a similar strikeout rate and an improved walk and groundball rate. That should make his home run rate and higher babip less of an issue for him.

Gomber is a good fill-in starter who should do better this year if he has positive strikeout, walk, babip regression like I am expecting from him. That should mitigate his probable uptick in home runs allowed due to his low groundball rate and allow him to compete  for the 5 starter spot.

Martinez is a solid starter who will probably be in the bullpen to start the season because of injury issues that have continued from 2018. This ranking considers that and that in short order he should be able to become the 3 starter again.

Poncedeleon is a mystery bag as we don't know how well he will do as his control is very questionable and his rates have been very variable over the course of his career.

Gonzalez had decent results in the MLB with the Marlins as a swingman but was dreadful in AA last year. Let him work as a starter in the minors.

CHC SP: Lester is a mid rotation guy at this point in his career, but it'll take an rebound which I think is very likely to happen. He'll chew innings and have a very good K/BB ratio while allowing home runs at a league average rate.

Hendricks is a great pitcher whose lack of velocity is a non-issue as he is able to limit walks, generate groundballs and get a surprisingly high amount of strikeouts than you'd think given his stuff.

Quintana and Hamels are interchangeable in the 3 and 4 spots, but Quintana has been better over a full season more recently.

Darvish is likely going to do very well with his strikeout and walk rates heading back to previous career levels along with his groundball rate, although his groundball rate might be a bit higher as facing a lot more pitchers batting will mean that he will improve his K/BB rates along with his groundball rate.

Montgomery will mainly stay in the bullpen as a swingman who will likely fill in the rest of the 5 starter starts. He's adequate in this and since he gets groundballs at a 50%+ clip he should be able to start if needed.

Mills is a better starter than Monty, but he'll likely be in AAA to start this year. He might be able to grab some starts if needed and should not have much issues other than a \~40% groundball rate.

Underwood Jr I think will perform similarly to Mills, but his minor league performance before last year leaves something to be desired. He should be able to be a 5 starter right now with more room to grow than Mills.

Tseng is a solid fifth starter capable pitcher had some homeritis last season, with his groundball tendencies being in the mid 40% range he should be ok as a 5 starter.

&amp;#x200B;

PIT SP: Archer is a great pitcher who has had frustrating results. His new sinker should help along with his home park, and the NL is less hitter friendly so that also helps. He'll rack up strikeouts and not allow too many walks.

Tallion is the co No 1 starter for the Pirates and looks like a dark horse CY YOUNG award candidate if he improves his strikeout rate which will likely occur with the addition and rate hike of his new slider he added last May.

Musgrove looks like a solid 3 starter with real upside for more as he limits walks well, gets groundballs and likely a strikeout rate bump due to his swinging strike rates.

Williams is probably the worst Pirates rotation starter as his strikeout to walk rate is lackluster. An expected groundball rate increase should make it likely for him to keep a rotation spot later in the season, and maybe a 25 man spot when Mitch Keller is deemed ready.

Lyles is a risky starter who looks like he can be a good pitcher who can get sustainable results that are similar to his pitching with the Padres last year. He'll probably be the 5 starter if he is 100% healthy which seems likely. His mid to high 40's groundball rate gives him an edge over Kingham as their expected K/BB rates look similar.

Kingham is the 5 starter at the moment as  Lyles is injured. His near 40% groundball rate is manageable as his strikeout rate is going to be at 8 K/9 and his walk rate is going to be near 3 BB/9, perhaps slightly lower along with a slightly higher GB rate to around 42% which will further lower his home run rate towards league levels mainly because of a lower hr/fb rate.

Keller looks like a great pitching prospect who could use a tune up in AAA to work on limiting walks. Whereas Holmes is a lesser pitching prospect who had a similar year by his K/BB rate in a swingman role. Holmes has had much higher groundball rates 60%+ vs mid to high 40's for Keller throughout their minor league careers. That's where the problem with his minor league career comes to play, his strikeout rate has never been above 8 K/9 for any full season before last season and his walk rate for a full season had never been below 4.22 BB/9.

Brubaker is a higher floor pitcher than Holmes. The reasons why he is so low on my list is he hasn't played in the majors yet and less groundball tendencies.

Slegers is a highly boring pitcher aside from his walk rate which rarely gets above 2 BB/9 generally. His mid 40% groundball rate is good, but his 6 K/9 is really lacking. He should be able to fill-in acceptably in case of an injury/need in the rotation.

TBR SP: There is nothing to really say about Snell other than he's an ace who should be able to produce at a low three ERA starter with very good K/BB rates.

Morton will probably pitch 160+ terrific mid three ERA innings with terrific velocity, K/BB rates, and a high groundball rate. Some minor injury concerns is the only issue I have aside from the fact that he is going to be 35.

Glasnow is a highly volatile, but the Rays think enough of him to not have an opener begin for him. Expecting high K and BB rates along with an improved groundball rate.

Yarborough is a follower who will probably accumulate 150+ innings. He should be able to improve upon solid K/BB rates and improve his groundball rate to become a full time starter by the end of 2019. Chirinos is similar in a lot of things aside from a lower expected walk rate and less health. Chirinos is below Yarborough due to health concerns.

Beeks has a chance to be like Ryan Yarborough last year depending on an injury and positive regression in his K/BB rates. He's got a good chance of accumulating innings for the Rays. Faria will probably pitch similarly to Beeks aside from a lower groundball rate and more of an injury history. Wilmer Font looks like a better, albeit less proven version of Faria.

Moore looks like a fill-in guy who needs to rebound from a poor season in AAA last year to be useful due to his low groundball rate. He used to be quite good by his K/BB rates and he's still young so such a rebound is possible.

ARI SP: Greinke is going to continue to be the usual #1 the Diamondbacks know and love with his great strikeout and walk rates in addition to a better than average groundball rate.

Ray is going to continue to be the same volatile starter we love. His strikeout rate is going to be sky high and hopefully his walk rate stays below 4 BB/9. He'll likely continue to be a good three starter who is the D-Back's #2 starter (not the bad kind).

Godley won't pitch in a godly manner, but he'll give Ray a run for his money as the 3rd best Diamondbacks starter, his high groundball rate is the key to success. If he can get his walk rate down to the low three's it was at in 2017 with his great strikeout and groundball rates he'll be better than the more volatile Ray.

Weaver looks like a good back end starter who could be a mid rotation guy if he rebounds to his pre-2018 levels. He had a down year last year and if it continues he'll probably be pushed out of the rotation again for one of Matt Andriese or Taijuan Walker if he's healthy enough for that.

I don't believe this! This is terrific news for Merrill Kelly! He's got the fifth starter spot out of spring training. He'll be a terrific starter who gets solid groundball numbers and \~8 K/9 and around 3 BB/9.

Andriese is a quality starter who limits walks and gets strikeouts while also getting groundballs at an above average rate. He'll be a great swingman for the Diamondbacks.

Koch could use some help in generating strikeouts as his 5 K/9 won't cut it. His walk and groundball rates should allow him to be a good fill-in starter if needed.

Clarke had a good season in AAA, but he's not getting enough strikeouts to mitigate his high 30's groundball rate. He could be alright as a spot starter.

COL SP: Freeland looks like he'll negatively regress a bit in his walk and strikeout rates, but an improved groundball rate should help him have a high three to low four ERA, which after accounting for Coors Field is a #3 starting pitcher who can be even better.

Marquez is a very good pitcher who should be expected to have 3+ K/BB ratio with more than a strikeout per inning pitched. With his solid walk and groundball rates, he should be a mid to high three ERA starter who should be considered a #2 starter giving Coors Field park factors consideration.

A better strand rate will help Gray pitch closer to mid rotation guy he is who gets strikeouts and limits walks very well. And since he worked out at driveline baseball this offseason, he might have taken his skills up to a new level.

Anderson is a good starting pitcher who gets great strikeout to walk rates but he's so streaky that it's like Eduardo Rodriguez or Michael Pineda almost. He should be a fine 4 starter who has tantalizing potential to be a 3 starter.

Bettis is not a great pitcher anymore aside from generating groundballs. But, I'm rooting for him as he has survived cancer and that's not an easy thing to do. He's gone through so much and he's still a capable fill-in starter.

If Senzatella was healthy, he would be the 5 starter. He's better in strikeout rate, walk rate and groundball rates as well.

Hoffman is a AAAA starter who is going downhill the more time he spends in the PCL. His walk and strikeout rates have gone in the wrong direction.

Almonte seems like a less proven version of Hoffman. Fortunately, Almonte looks like he could be used as a multi inning relief pitcher instead.

NYM SP: DeGrom is an ACE and CY YOUNG award candidate. He's got wicked stuff which helps him get tons of strikeouts and his control/command helps him with limiting walks and generating groundballs.

Thor, the Nordic God of Thunder is an injury prone starter who is the Co ACE of the Mets when healthy. The key for Syndergaard is to stay healthy and he's a CY YOUNG award candidate.

Wheeler had the most surprising breakout season and he's a dark horse CY YOUNG award candidate if he can continue his terrific second half of last season and stays in the majors all season in 2019 with more health than his previous track record.

Matz is another injury prone starter, provided he can stay healthy he should be able to be a 4 starter who pitches like a 3 starter.

Vargas is not a good starting pitcher anymore and is on his way out of baseball. He's not going to be able to get by with slow fastball and lacking K/BB rates.

Gagnon is the in house candidate I want the Mets to use over Jason Vargas as he is a member of my version of the Ken Phelps all star team due to his success in the PCL last year.

Oswalt is a solid fill-in starter who would be best served getting traded to a team with a rotation need as his strikeout rate, groundball and home run allowed rate should positively regress towards his minor league levels.

Lockett is a solid prospect who could start, but his results last year look unsustainable relative to his previous minor league performance.

&amp;#x200B;

HOU SP: Verlander is the guy I would've given the CY Young award last season over Snell who was a very deserving candidate. He's consistently been a top starter and he's reached a new level in 2018 with 290 K's to a mere 37 walks.

Same thing with Cole as he pitched better than ever in 2018. I'd expect a small negative regression in his strikeout rate by default as he struck out a lot of batters last year and it's probably not that repeatable. He's still the Co ACE of the Astros.

McHugh and Peacock should become mid-rotation starters again after terrific years in the bullpen. They'll do well with strikeouts and walks and generating groundballs.

Miley had made a pitch change and became a better pitcher by using a cutter more. I'd like to think that Houston has plans on making him even better, otherwise he's a good placeholder for the Astros to get top prospects ready to take his spot.

If James was healthy, he'd have been in the top 5 starters for the Astros. For now, he'll be a great reliever and he'll stretch out and perhaps take Miley's rotation spot.

Armenteros may not have stuff, but he's greater than the sum of his parts and that sum could turn into a three starter quality work out of 40+ FV parts.

Valdez is an interesting starter/swingman with his groundball tendencies, especially if he can get his walk rate and strikeout rates more in line with his minor league levels. I'd be more interested if he was used as a starter more last season.

Rodgers is an unknown due to missing most of 2017 and 2018 due to injuries. He should be good, his health dropped him here.

LAD SP: Buehler isn't the opening day starter, but he's the best healthy starter. He might be a dark horse CY YOUNG award candidate if he throws more innings this year (180 IP). He might have strikeout and walk rate regress positively and that is scary good.

Everyone thought it was questionable to give a pitcher like Ryu a qualifying offer and he accepted it. So far he has not thrown a single inning and he's already been a help by pitching opening day. He'll be great when healthy (#3 starter) despite negative regression in his strikeout and walk rates.

Maeda is a mid rotation starter who generates strikeouts and limits walks. His injury history is also a bit of a concern.

Stripling, despite adjusting for negative regression looks like a terrific starter who could be the 2nd best starter who is currently healthy.

Despite Urias' injury history, he is the current 5 starter. He'll likely be a follower/swingman depending on if the Dodgers use openers. Expecting strikeouts and a higher than average walk rate.

Kershaw's the usual injury prone starter who is terrific when healthy. He'll be back in April and he'll probably be able to pitch well as long as his innings are relatively limited due to probable injuries. His walks and strikeouts will be not as good as usual, but he'll do well.

Hill will be out for who knows how long, but he's trending up with his excellent spring training performance as he didn't allow a walk and if his K/BB rates go up in 2019 while healthy he'll be terrific. Don't expect more than 150 innings.

Ferguson looks like a swingman/multi inning relief pitcher. He'll get strikeouts and not allow as many walks as urias, but he needs to work on his home run allowed problem. He'll probably be a starter in AAA if he's not on the roster.

Santana looks like he can be a mid rotation guy, provided he can get some innings which he'll probably get as a starter in AAA or as a multi inning relief pitcher in the MLB.

Stewart is a classic change of scenery candidate. He's got stuff and can be a good starter if he can get a consistent role instead of being used as he has been in the last two years.

WAS SP: Mad Max will be the CY YOUNG award contender even with his lack of groundball tendencies due to his terrific strikeout to walk rates.

Strasburg looks like he'll be a great #2 starter provided he is healthy, he has great stuff and he gets great K/BB rates.

Corbin is a very good starting pitcher who increased the use of his slider and his strikeout rate skyrocketed. He'll probably not do quite as well as last year, but he'll still be a #2 starter.

Sanchez is another breakout starter who implemented a pitch selection change to excellent effect. He utilized higher use of a cutter to great effect on his home run rate as he had home run and flyball tendencies. He should be able to maintain a lot of this to a lesser extent over more innings will be even more valuable.

Hellickson seems like he'll be an inning chewer who limits walks and gets groundballs while getting enough strikeouts to be a league average starter.

Fedde is really good at getting groundballs, and gets good K/BB rates. He should be ready to start if Hellickson is out. He just needs consistent playing time to show it in a bigger samples.

Ross is very good when healthy, unfortunately he is coming back from Tommy John Surgery and he seemed rusty last year. I'm expecting some more rust to fall off and for him to get close to his previous levels provided he is healthy.

McGowin and Voth look like AAA depth guys who could be better than just fifth starters. Excellent insurance for the Nationals.

NYY SP: Paxton is a less healthy version of Scherzer as he has never pitched more than 160 IP in a season, if he can get more groundballs like he had in his career previously and more innings he'll be an ACE.

Tanaka is a peculiar starting pitcher who has been pitching on a partially torn UCL for years. He'll get strikeouts, walks and groundballs. Unfortunately, he allows more hard contact than average and allows more homers than expected. He'll be fine as the opening day starter.

Happ had a strikeout surge with increased velocity and a change in approach. He's throwing more elevated fastballs and getting more strikeouts as a result. He'll have some regression, but he'll be terrific 3 starter and he'll be an amazing 4 starter once Severino is healthy. And he'll be willing to make adjustments for more success.

German will be the 4 starter for now since he can get strikeouts and not walk too many. He also has a history of mid 40's groundball rates in the minors which will help him do well.

Loaisiga will be the 5 starter once Sabathia's suspension is over. It'll be temporary because he'll have to be in multi inning relief pitcher to get the most value out of him due to his lack of health in his career.

Cessa is the next man up who looks like a potential swingman who could be great with a rotation spot for another team with his groundball rate and promising peripherals in AAA as a starter.

Severino won't be ready until May, but when he gets back he should be an ACE the rest of the year. His strikeout and walk rates are superb and he would have been a CY YOUNG award candidate. Sabathia's the fifth starter once he's healthy and keep it unless one of the temporary starters do better.

Gonzalez needs to get stretched out but he should be able to hold a rotation spot if Severino is out longer than expected. He's about league average now.

Hutchison and Hale are Quad A guys who could be fifth starters on weaker rotations. They need to go somewhere else for success.

Adams is down here due to a down year in AAA last year. Hopefully he can fix it there, I'm skeptical about it though.

BOS SP: Sale is a definite ACE especially if he stays healthy. Even with some flyball tendencies, his strikeout and walk rates will help him be dominant thanks to his filthy stuff.

Price is right for the Red Sox as their #2 starter who will pitch like one if he throws 200 innings. He's good with strikeouts and walks while getting groundballs.

Porcello will be a great #3 inning chewer who will get strikeouts and limit walks, despite his declining groundball rate.

Eovaldi gets plenty of strikeouts and limits walks well, and gets groundballs with a great 93 mph cutter he throws.

Rodriguez will get strikeouts and not walk a lot of batters, but he has flyball tendencies and he seems to struggle to get deep into games because he throws too many pitches per inning.

Johnson is a good swingman who has some flyball tendencies and lacks fastball velocity. His K/BB is below average, but acceptable.

Ramirez looks like a good swingman option for the Red Sox especially if he can regain his previous levels of success.

Velasquez might finally stick to being a multi inning relief pitcher who is starter capable.

Kluber is going to be an ACE still with his high strikeout rate and low walk rate. His home run rate is creeping up though.

Carrasco will get more strikeouts and walks, but he'll probably pitch slightly less innings which makes him a secondary ACE.

Bauer is a coACE and provided he stays healthy he'll be dominant again in 2019 by generating strikeouts, not walking a lot of batters and getting groundballs.

Bieber is a graduated prospect who walks very few batters, even with increased slider usage his walk rate will be low, but his strikeout rate will be really exciting and he'll allow less home runs.

Clevinger is like Bauer with less strikeouts and groundballs. But, that's still a very useful pitcher to have pitch 200 innings for your team. He'll be a terrific 4 or 5 starter.

Hu's also on the bump, he's a good plugin guy in case of an injury. He'll get good K/BB rates.

&amp;#x200B;

This only took so long because it was too big and had to be split into two parts. And other reasons

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIN SP: Castillo looks like a great starter who is going to increase his strikeout, walks and groundball rates. In turn, he should pitch better and get better results despite not having Billy Hamilton in center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray looks like getting away from the DH, Yankee stadium and the AL East will do him a tremendous amount of good. Not to mention that his college pitching coach from Vanderbilt university is no the Cincinnati Reds pitching coach. Expecting a big bounce back year even if he&amp;#39;s going to another hitter friendly park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeSclafani looks like a solid starter if he can stay healthy who will have a better groundball rate, which should help his home run rate to go down in addition to a HR/FB rate at league average he should have a home run rate close to his career average. His strikeout rate will also likely go down unless his curveball improved, but I&amp;#39;d prefer him throwing more changeups instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roark is an inning chewer who should have better results due to an increased groundball rate and a slightly lower Homer rate due to hr/fb increase and a more hitter friendly park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahle is a confusing pitcher who should be a good spot starter/fill in even if he doesn&amp;#39;t improve his secondary pitches like he should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood looks like a good starter, especially when he is healthy. He should have positive regression in his strikeout and groundball rates. Unfortunately, a walk rate, home run rate increase coupled with a weaker defense and more hitter friendly park will likely mean he&amp;#39;ll be a mid to high 3 ERA pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reed is a good pitcher who looks like he should be able to start if and when Wood and or Roark are traded. His groundball rate should regress towards 50% but he should be able to do better than Tanner Roark on a per inning basis. His results should not be effected as his hr/fb ratio will regress towards MLB average levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romano is a guy who even if he improves his strikeout, groundball and home run rate I don&amp;#39;t think should be in the rotation at the moment. Maybe after midseason trades he could get some starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopez is a prospect who is going to get some positive regression in K/BB rates and groundball rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHI SP: Nola is nothing more than an ACE starting pitcher who had a CY YOUNG award worthy season last year. He should be able to do similarly and be a consistent CY YOUNG award contender for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrieta is a solid inning chewer who used to be much better than he is now. He should be able to get better strikeout rates to pitch better and having a better defense should only help even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pivetta reminds me of Pineda and Ricky Nolasco back in the day. He&amp;#39;ll get strikeouts, do good with walks and get some groundballs. He should be expected to do better thanks to a better defense which should lower his babip, also he should be expected to have a lower hr/fb rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velasquez is a high octane starter who gets strikeouts and doesn&amp;#39;t walk too many. His flyball tendencies put him below Pivetta even though they don&amp;#39;t pitch long into the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elfin is a solid starter who should be able to get the 5 starter spot over Eickhoff. He gets strikeouts and limits walks. Keep an eye on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De los Santos is not from GTA V but he&amp;#39;s a perfectly good fill-in starter who is healthy unlike Eickhoff. If I know he&amp;#39;s healthy, De los Santos would be below Eickhoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eickhoff is a contender for the 5 spot. Good strikeout to walk rate with a lower groundball rate than that is safe for his home park. His previous inning chewer status was important and should be important for his value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anderson has a similar current value as De los Santos does, but his AA performance in 2017 was concerning and I am considering that in my depth chart along with his lower groundball rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suarez is a depth starter who needs to get more strikeouts to be seriously worth looking at considering his walk rate is merely ok. To be honest, his groundball rate gives him a chance at any future starting pitcher role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STL SP: Mikolas is a great inning chewer who has velocity and limits walks extremely well. He also can get strikeouts. He should be able to get more strikeouts this year with his stuff, albeit with a slightly higher walk rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flaherty is a solid starter who is likely to improve his walk rate next year while continuing to get plenty of strikeouts, he&amp;#39;s also going to benefit a little from generating a few more groundballs. He hasn&amp;#39;t pitched a lot of innings per start, but he&amp;#39;s plenty valuable as it is with his current profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wacha should be a solid mid to back rotation guy depending on his health and consistency as his strikeout to walk rate is more good not great and it&amp;#39;s plenty for his slightly above average groundball rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wainwright is a better name than he is a pitcher at this point, but he should be an acceptable back end guy if he can stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hudson looks like an extreme groundball pitcher who has a high floor and lacking K/BB rates in AAA, I&amp;#39;m not exactly impressed by him but the Cardinals love him so we&amp;#39;ll see. They&amp;#39;re pretty good about pitchers, so I think I&amp;#39;ll trust them on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gant should be a solid fill-in starter who can be a 5 starter, he should have a similar strikeout rate and an improved walk and groundball rate. That should make his home run rate and higher babip less of an issue for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gomber is a good fill-in starter who should do better this year if he has positive strikeout, walk, babip regression like I am expecting from him. That should mitigate his probable uptick in home runs allowed due to his low groundball rate and allow him to compete  for the 5 starter spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martinez is a solid starter who will probably be in the bullpen to start the season because of injury issues that have continued from 2018. This ranking considers that and that in short order he should be able to become the 3 starter again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poncedeleon is a mystery bag as we don&amp;#39;t know how well he will do as his control is very questionable and his rates have been very variable over the course of his career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez had decent results in the MLB with the Marlins as a swingman but was dreadful in AA last year. Let him work as a starter in the minors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHC SP: Lester is a mid rotation guy at this point in his career, but it&amp;#39;ll take an rebound which I think is very likely to happen. He&amp;#39;ll chew innings and have a very good K/BB ratio while allowing home runs at a league average rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hendricks is a great pitcher whose lack of velocity is a non-issue as he is able to limit walks, generate groundballs and get a surprisingly high amount of strikeouts than you&amp;#39;d think given his stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quintana and Hamels are interchangeable in the 3 and 4 spots, but Quintana has been better over a full season more recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darvish is likely going to do very well with his strikeout and walk rates heading back to previous career levels along with his groundball rate, although his groundball rate might be a bit higher as facing a lot more pitchers batting will mean that he will improve his K/BB rates along with his groundball rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montgomery will mainly stay in the bullpen as a swingman who will likely fill in the rest of the 5 starter starts. He&amp;#39;s adequate in this and since he gets groundballs at a 50%+ clip he should be able to start if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mills is a better starter than Monty, but he&amp;#39;ll likely be in AAA to start this year. He might be able to grab some starts if needed and should not have much issues other than a ~40% groundball rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underwood Jr I think will perform similarly to Mills, but his minor league performance before last year leaves something to be desired. He should be able to be a 5 starter right now with more room to grow than Mills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tseng is a solid fifth starter capable pitcher had some homeritis last season, with his groundball tendencies being in the mid 40% range he should be ok as a 5 starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PIT SP: Archer is a great pitcher who has had frustrating results. His new sinker should help along with his home park, and the NL is less hitter friendly so that also helps. He&amp;#39;ll rack up strikeouts and not allow too many walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tallion is the co No 1 starter for the Pirates and looks like a dark horse CY YOUNG award candidate if he improves his strikeout rate which will likely occur with the addition and rate hike of his new slider he added last May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musgrove looks like a solid 3 starter with real upside for more as he limits walks well, gets groundballs and likely a strikeout rate bump due to his swinging strike rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams is probably the worst Pirates rotation starter as his strikeout to walk rate is lackluster. An expected groundball rate increase should make it likely for him to keep a rotation spot later in the season, and maybe a 25 man spot when Mitch Keller is deemed ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lyles is a risky starter who looks like he can be a good pitcher who can get sustainable results that are similar to his pitching with the Padres last year. He&amp;#39;ll probably be the 5 starter if he is 100% healthy which seems likely. His mid to high 40&amp;#39;s groundball rate gives him an edge over Kingham as their expected K/BB rates look similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kingham is the 5 starter at the moment as  Lyles is injured. His near 40% groundball rate is manageable as his strikeout rate is going to be at 8 K/9 and his walk rate is going to be near 3 BB/9, perhaps slightly lower along with a slightly higher GB rate to around 42% which will further lower his home run rate towards league levels mainly because of a lower hr/fb rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keller looks like a great pitching prospect who could use a tune up in AAA to work on limiting walks. Whereas Holmes is a lesser pitching prospect who had a similar year by his K/BB rate in a swingman role. Holmes has had much higher groundball rates 60%+ vs mid to high 40&amp;#39;s for Keller throughout their minor league careers. That&amp;#39;s where the problem with his minor league career comes to play, his strikeout rate has never been above 8 K/9 for any full season before last season and his walk rate for a full season had never been below 4.22 BB/9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brubaker is a higher floor pitcher than Holmes. The reasons why he is so low on my list is he hasn&amp;#39;t played in the majors yet and less groundball tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slegers is a highly boring pitcher aside from his walk rate which rarely gets above 2 BB/9 generally. His mid 40% groundball rate is good, but his 6 K/9 is really lacking. He should be able to fill-in acceptably in case of an injury/need in the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBR SP: There is nothing to really say about Snell other than he&amp;#39;s an ace who should be able to produce at a low three ERA starter with very good K/BB rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morton will probably pitch 160+ terrific mid three ERA innings with terrific velocity, K/BB rates, and a high groundball rate. Some minor injury concerns is the only issue I have aside from the fact that he is going to be 35.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glasnow is a highly volatile, but the Rays think enough of him to not have an opener begin for him. Expecting high K and BB rates along with an improved groundball rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yarborough is a follower who will probably accumulate 150+ innings. He should be able to improve upon solid K/BB rates and improve his groundball rate to become a full time starter by the end of 2019. Chirinos is similar in a lot of things aside from a lower expected walk rate and less health. Chirinos is below Yarborough due to health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beeks has a chance to be like Ryan Yarborough last year depending on an injury and positive regression in his K/BB rates. He&amp;#39;s got a good chance of accumulating innings for the Rays. Faria will probably pitch similarly to Beeks aside from a lower groundball rate and more of an injury history. Wilmer Font looks like a better, albeit less proven version of Faria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moore looks like a fill-in guy who needs to rebound from a poor season in AAA last year to be useful due to his low groundball rate. He used to be quite good by his K/BB rates and he&amp;#39;s still young so such a rebound is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARI SP: Greinke is going to continue to be the usual #1 the Diamondbacks know and love with his great strikeout and walk rates in addition to a better than average groundball rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray is going to continue to be the same volatile starter we love. His strikeout rate is going to be sky high and hopefully his walk rate stays below 4 BB/9. He&amp;#39;ll likely continue to be a good three starter who is the D-Back&amp;#39;s #2 starter (not the bad kind).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Godley won&amp;#39;t pitch in a godly manner, but he&amp;#39;ll give Ray a run for his money as the 3rd best Diamondbacks starter, his high groundball rate is the key to success. If he can get his walk rate down to the low three&amp;#39;s it was at in 2017 with his great strikeout and groundball rates he&amp;#39;ll be better than the more volatile Ray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weaver looks like a good back end starter who could be a mid rotation guy if he rebounds to his pre-2018 levels. He had a down year last year and if it continues he&amp;#39;ll probably be pushed out of the rotation again for one of Matt Andriese or Taijuan Walker if he&amp;#39;s healthy enough for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe this! This is terrific news for Merrill Kelly! He&amp;#39;s got the fifth starter spot out of spring training. He&amp;#39;ll be a terrific starter who gets solid groundball numbers and ~8 K/9 and around 3 BB/9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andriese is a quality starter who limits walks and gets strikeouts while also getting groundballs at an above average rate. He&amp;#39;ll be a great swingman for the Diamondbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koch could use some help in generating strikeouts as his 5 K/9 won&amp;#39;t cut it. His walk and groundball rates should allow him to be a good fill-in starter if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarke had a good season in AAA, but he&amp;#39;s not getting enough strikeouts to mitigate his high 30&amp;#39;s groundball rate. He could be alright as a spot starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COL SP: Freeland looks like he&amp;#39;ll negatively regress a bit in his walk and strikeout rates, but an improved groundball rate should help him have a high three to low four ERA, which after accounting for Coors Field is a #3 starting pitcher who can be even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marquez is a very good pitcher who should be expected to have 3+ K/BB ratio with more than a strikeout per inning pitched. With his solid walk and groundball rates, he should be a mid to high three ERA starter who should be considered a #2 starter giving Coors Field park factors consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better strand rate will help Gray pitch closer to mid rotation guy he is who gets strikeouts and limits walks very well. And since he worked out at driveline baseball this offseason, he might have taken his skills up to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anderson is a good starting pitcher who gets great strikeout to walk rates but he&amp;#39;s so streaky that it&amp;#39;s like Eduardo Rodriguez or Michael Pineda almost. He should be a fine 4 starter who has tantalizing potential to be a 3 starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bettis is not a great pitcher anymore aside from generating groundballs. But, I&amp;#39;m rooting for him as he has survived cancer and that&amp;#39;s not an easy thing to do. He&amp;#39;s gone through so much and he&amp;#39;s still a capable fill-in starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Senzatella was healthy, he would be the 5 starter. He&amp;#39;s better in strikeout rate, walk rate and groundball rates as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoffman is a AAAA starter who is going downhill the more time he spends in the PCL. His walk and strikeout rates have gone in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almonte seems like a less proven version of Hoffman. Fortunately, Almonte looks like he could be used as a multi inning relief pitcher instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYM SP: DeGrom is an ACE and CY YOUNG award candidate. He&amp;#39;s got wicked stuff which helps him get tons of strikeouts and his control/command helps him with limiting walks and generating groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thor, the Nordic God of Thunder is an injury prone starter who is the Co ACE of the Mets when healthy. The key for Syndergaard is to stay healthy and he&amp;#39;s a CY YOUNG award candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wheeler had the most surprising breakout season and he&amp;#39;s a dark horse CY YOUNG award candidate if he can continue his terrific second half of last season and stays in the majors all season in 2019 with more health than his previous track record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matz is another injury prone starter, provided he can stay healthy he should be able to be a 4 starter who pitches like a 3 starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vargas is not a good starting pitcher anymore and is on his way out of baseball. He&amp;#39;s not going to be able to get by with slow fastball and lacking K/BB rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gagnon is the in house candidate I want the Mets to use over Jason Vargas as he is a member of my version of the Ken Phelps all star team due to his success in the PCL last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oswalt is a solid fill-in starter who would be best served getting traded to a team with a rotation need as his strikeout rate, groundball and home run allowed rate should positively regress towards his minor league levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lockett is a solid prospect who could start, but his results last year look unsustainable relative to his previous minor league performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOU SP: Verlander is the guy I would&amp;#39;ve given the CY Young award last season over Snell who was a very deserving candidate. He&amp;#39;s consistently been a top starter and he&amp;#39;s reached a new level in 2018 with 290 K&amp;#39;s to a mere 37 walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same thing with Cole as he pitched better than ever in 2018. I&amp;#39;d expect a small negative regression in his strikeout rate by default as he struck out a lot of batters last year and it&amp;#39;s probably not that repeatable. He&amp;#39;s still the Co ACE of the Astros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McHugh and Peacock should become mid-rotation starters again after terrific years in the bullpen. They&amp;#39;ll do well with strikeouts and walks and generating groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miley had made a pitch change and became a better pitcher by using a cutter more. I&amp;#39;d like to think that Houston has plans on making him even better, otherwise he&amp;#39;s a good placeholder for the Astros to get top prospects ready to take his spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If James was healthy, he&amp;#39;d have been in the top 5 starters for the Astros. For now, he&amp;#39;ll be a great reliever and he&amp;#39;ll stretch out and perhaps take Miley&amp;#39;s rotation spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenteros may not have stuff, but he&amp;#39;s greater than the sum of his parts and that sum could turn into a three starter quality work out of 40+ FV parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valdez is an interesting starter/swingman with his groundball tendencies, especially if he can get his walk rate and strikeout rates more in line with his minor league levels. I&amp;#39;d be more interested if he was used as a starter more last season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rodgers is an unknown due to missing most of 2017 and 2018 due to injuries. He should be good, his health dropped him here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAD SP: Buehler isn&amp;#39;t the opening day starter, but he&amp;#39;s the best healthy starter. He might be a dark horse CY YOUNG award candidate if he throws more innings this year (180 IP). He might have strikeout and walk rate regress positively and that is scary good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone thought it was questionable to give a pitcher like Ryu a qualifying offer and he accepted it. So far he has not thrown a single inning and he&amp;#39;s already been a help by pitching opening day. He&amp;#39;ll be great when healthy (#3 starter) despite negative regression in his strikeout and walk rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maeda is a mid rotation starter who generates strikeouts and limits walks. His injury history is also a bit of a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripling, despite adjusting for negative regression looks like a terrific starter who could be the 2nd best starter who is currently healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Urias&amp;#39; injury history, he is the current 5 starter. He&amp;#39;ll likely be a follower/swingman depending on if the Dodgers use openers. Expecting strikeouts and a higher than average walk rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kershaw&amp;#39;s the usual injury prone starter who is terrific when healthy. He&amp;#39;ll be back in April and he&amp;#39;ll probably be able to pitch well as long as his innings are relatively limited due to probable injuries. His walks and strikeouts will be not as good as usual, but he&amp;#39;ll do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hill will be out for who knows how long, but he&amp;#39;s trending up with his excellent spring training performance as he didn&amp;#39;t allow a walk and if his K/BB rates go up in 2019 while healthy he&amp;#39;ll be terrific. Don&amp;#39;t expect more than 150 innings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferguson looks like a swingman/multi inning relief pitcher. He&amp;#39;ll get strikeouts and not allow as many walks as urias, but he needs to work on his home run allowed problem. He&amp;#39;ll probably be a starter in AAA if he&amp;#39;s not on the roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santana looks like he can be a mid rotation guy, provided he can get some innings which he&amp;#39;ll probably get as a starter in AAA or as a multi inning relief pitcher in the MLB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart is a classic change of scenery candidate. He&amp;#39;s got stuff and can be a good starter if he can get a consistent role instead of being used as he has been in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WAS SP: Mad Max will be the CY YOUNG award contender even with his lack of groundball tendencies due to his terrific strikeout to walk rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strasburg looks like he&amp;#39;ll be a great #2 starter provided he is healthy, he has great stuff and he gets great K/BB rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin is a very good starting pitcher who increased the use of his slider and his strikeout rate skyrocketed. He&amp;#39;ll probably not do quite as well as last year, but he&amp;#39;ll still be a #2 starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanchez is another breakout starter who implemented a pitch selection change to excellent effect. He utilized higher use of a cutter to great effect on his home run rate as he had home run and flyball tendencies. He should be able to maintain a lot of this to a lesser extent over more innings will be even more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hellickson seems like he&amp;#39;ll be an inning chewer who limits walks and gets groundballs while getting enough strikeouts to be a league average starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fedde is really good at getting groundballs, and gets good K/BB rates. He should be ready to start if Hellickson is out. He just needs consistent playing time to show it in a bigger samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross is very good when healthy, unfortunately he is coming back from Tommy John Surgery and he seemed rusty last year. I&amp;#39;m expecting some more rust to fall off and for him to get close to his previous levels provided he is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McGowin and Voth look like AAA depth guys who could be better than just fifth starters. Excellent insurance for the Nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYY SP: Paxton is a less healthy version of Scherzer as he has never pitched more than 160 IP in a season, if he can get more groundballs like he had in his career previously and more innings he&amp;#39;ll be an ACE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanaka is a peculiar starting pitcher who has been pitching on a partially torn UCL for years. He&amp;#39;ll get strikeouts, walks and groundballs. Unfortunately, he allows more hard contact than average and allows more homers than expected. He&amp;#39;ll be fine as the opening day starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happ had a strikeout surge with increased velocity and a change in approach. He&amp;#39;s throwing more elevated fastballs and getting more strikeouts as a result. He&amp;#39;ll have some regression, but he&amp;#39;ll be terrific 3 starter and he&amp;#39;ll be an amazing 4 starter once Severino is healthy. And he&amp;#39;ll be willing to make adjustments for more success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German will be the 4 starter for now since he can get strikeouts and not walk too many. He also has a history of mid 40&amp;#39;s groundball rates in the minors which will help him do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loaisiga will be the 5 starter once Sabathia&amp;#39;s suspension is over. It&amp;#39;ll be temporary because he&amp;#39;ll have to be in multi inning relief pitcher to get the most value out of him due to his lack of health in his career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cessa is the next man up who looks like a potential swingman who could be great with a rotation spot for another team with his groundball rate and promising peripherals in AAA as a starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Severino won&amp;#39;t be ready until May, but when he gets back he should be an ACE the rest of the year. His strikeout and walk rates are superb and he would have been a CY YOUNG award candidate. Sabathia&amp;#39;s the fifth starter once he&amp;#39;s healthy and keep it unless one of the temporary starters do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez needs to get stretched out but he should be able to hold a rotation spot if Severino is out longer than expected. He&amp;#39;s about league average now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hutchison and Hale are Quad A guys who could be fifth starters on weaker rotations. They need to go somewhere else for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams is down here due to a down year in AAA last year. Hopefully he can fix it there, I&amp;#39;m skeptical about it though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOS SP: Sale is a definite ACE especially if he stays healthy. Even with some flyball tendencies, his strikeout and walk rates will help him be dominant thanks to his filthy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price is right for the Red Sox as their #2 starter who will pitch like one if he throws 200 innings. He&amp;#39;s good with strikeouts and walks while getting groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porcello will be a great #3 inning chewer who will get strikeouts and limit walks, despite his declining groundball rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eovaldi gets plenty of strikeouts and limits walks well, and gets groundballs with a great 93 mph cutter he throws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez will get strikeouts and not walk a lot of batters, but he has flyball tendencies and he seems to struggle to get deep into games because he throws too many pitches per inning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson is a good swingman who has some flyball tendencies and lacks fastball velocity. His K/BB is below average, but acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramirez looks like a good swingman option for the Red Sox especially if he can regain his previous levels of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velasquez might finally stick to being a multi inning relief pitcher who is starter capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kluber is going to be an ACE still with his high strikeout rate and low walk rate. His home run rate is creeping up though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrasco will get more strikeouts and walks, but he&amp;#39;ll probably pitch slightly less innings which makes him a secondary ACE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bauer is a coACE and provided he stays healthy he&amp;#39;ll be dominant again in 2019 by generating strikeouts, not walking a lot of batters and getting groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bieber is a graduated prospect who walks very few batters, even with increased slider usage his walk rate will be low, but his strikeout rate will be really exciting and he&amp;#39;ll allow less home runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clevinger is like Bauer with less strikeouts and groundballs. But, that&amp;#39;s still a very useful pitcher to have pitch 200 innings for your team. He&amp;#39;ll be a terrific 4 or 5 starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hu&amp;#39;s also on the bump, he&amp;#39;s a good plugin guy in case of an injury. He&amp;#39;ll get good K/BB rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only took so long because it was too big and had to be split into two parts. And other reasons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Cobb is too much money for his performance. That said, he is a good pitcher.

Karns, health permitting he could be the best starter in the rotation.

Cashner should be released as he likely won't be a great trade piece.

Hess has to go back to AAA and develop a sinker as he allows too many flyballs and homers to be able to be an effective starting pitcher.

Ramirez is one guy who I want to see get a crack as a full-time starting pitcher.

Yacabonis is another guy who I want in the rotation over Cashner or Hess.

Wright was ready as anyone to replace Chris Tillman in 2017 when Tillman was clearly not ok. He should be able to fill-in acceptably.

Means looks like another guy who I would rather have than Hess.

&amp;#x200B;

CWS SP: Rodon likely will be a great bounce back candidate as he will be able to have a normal offseason to be ready for this season.

Nova is an inning eating pitcher who can help the team by giving the team a guy who can pitch so prospects can develop and be traded for better prospects than they gave up in the offseason for Nova.

Lopez is good right now as a starter, but he has a lot more potential to reach.

Giolito: If he can improve upon his second half he should be good. He might be sent down due to a lack of performance like Carson Fulmer was.

Santana had been a solid, durable mid rotation guy with solid rates. If he's healthy this year unlike his bad year in 2018 he should be able to be able to take the 5 starter spot over Covey, otherwise he's probably not going to make the team.

Covey had a good stretch where he got a lot of groundballs and was doing enough in terms of strikeout to walk rates to be effective. He's got a shot to start as the fifth starter.

Banuelos pretty much fell off the face of the earth only for him to come back with the Oklahoma city Dodgers. He'll be great competition for the 5th spot in the rotation.

Stephens is borderline MLB ready and could fill in shortly if needed. He could use some more refining in AAA.

Cease might just fill your Michael Kopech sized void in your White Sox fan heart. He's going to have to get better at limiting walks but his strikeout rate is tasty right now.

&amp;#x200B;

OAK SP: Fiers will be a great pitcher at a low cost while getting strikeouts and limiting walks. Another 3 WAR season is not out of the question.

Estrada's flyball tendencies should be mitigated by his new home stadium and the fact that the only team in his division with a great team is Houston. A great veteran presence.

Montas, Bassitt, Anderson, and Mengeden are all risky bets as starting pitchers but they can be good as fill-ins for Puk and Luzardo when they are ready. Anderson in particular is an injury risk.

Blackburn could be a good starter with his skill at limiting walks. He should be able to start in place of one of the three above and will do just as good.

Brooks, Alexander, and Bridwell are minor league depth who can make a big league start in a pinch. Doesn't mean you'll like the results. Alexander is the most promising of the three and the biggest hothead. His work in independent ball and Mexico has been impressive enough to get him a spring training invite.

DET SP: Boyd is a good pitcher who solidified his own rotation spot last season. He could be even better.

Zimmerman is a slightly overpriced veteran starting pitcher. He did well and can do even better if he can get his groundball rate up to previous levels.

Ross (TB) is one of my favorite groundballers who can do even better with more time away from his surgery.

Hardy is good swingman who deserves a chance to start with the Tigers. Much better than Matt Moore and could be even better if he gets a full season of starts in. I'd expect his innings to be limited to 155 as he got 112 1/3 last season.

Turnbull was particularly exciting in small AAA and MLB samples. He could be quite good as he also got 45%+ groundballs.

Moore should be released in spring training unless he shows he has fixed some things. Maybe he should be a multi inning relief pitcher first and then he can start. Because last year was disappointing.

Norris needs to be able to stay healthy and be consistent with his performance. That's the most important as he's been able to do well when healthy.

I'm intrigued by Hall and I want to see him start in the rotation full time. It might be 2020 when I see that happen.

Carpenter is a better version of David Hess as he can get more strikeouts and limit walks better than Hess while getting more groundballs.

KCR SP: Duffy had a down year, hopefully he can return to his previous levels in 2016-2017. He's tentatively the ""ace"" of the Royals.

Junis was the Royals best pitcher last year and he could do better if his HR/FB ratio goes down to league average. In addition, he has potential to get more groundballs and limit the chance of himself allowing home runs.

Keller will regress in his performance yet still be a good pitcher. His strikeout rate will go up, but so will his walks and home runs allowed. His groundball tendencies are quite helpful especially when his flyballs are mitigated by his home stadium.

Ellis is one of the Royals rule 5 draft picks. He appears to be ready to fill in a rotation spot based on his AAA performance and groundball rate which can be mitigated by his new home stadium as it was 38% in the PCL.

Bailey has come here to Kansas City to try for a starting role. He's likely going to do better than last year but he'll probably just miss the 4 starter spot to Ellis.

Kennedy is a good pitcher by strikeouts and walks, but his flyball tendencies are not mitigated enough by Kauffman Stadium. If he can get his groundball rate back into the mid-30's then he can be more useful.

Lopez and Fillmyer don't impress me by their K/BB but they get enough groundballs to mitigate that issue. I prefer Fillmyer because he has been able to pitch more innings recently than Lopez.

Kalish looks like a good pitcher if he can get his groundball rate back to his minor league levels. Better than Lively and the two above him.

Lively and Sparkman are two depth guys who did well in AAA. I personally prefer Lively, but acknowledge that Sparkman has a higher floor.

Barlow could use some work on his command as his 4 BB/9 in the PCL won't cut it in the majors. Although the time he spent last year as a long reliever in a small sample did impress as he had 9 K/9 to 1.8 BB/9 which if he can approximate such performance he could be amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

SEA SP: Marcos Gonzales was one of their breakout starting pitchers last year. He got strikeouts and limited walks.

Leake was predictable as usual and was his usual, boring self that continues to chew innings.

Kikuchi was very good in Japan last season and was even better in 2017. He should be able to perform similarly to Maeda with more walks and more strikeouts than Mikolas. He's a much better and harder throwing version of Kei Igawa that can get groundballs.

Wade LeBlanc should do as well as he did last season as the Mariners second starting pitcher breakout.

Sheffield: High octane pitching prospect who has already been traded twice in his short career. (The Andrew Miller trade and now the James Paxton deal this offseason.). He needs to work on command/control of his great stuff. He's tentatively the fifth starter but the Mariners will sneak in some starts for aging ace Felix Hernandez. Frankly, Sheffield should have a tune up in AAA.

Hernandez: Get this guy to driveline baseball ASAP to see what can be fixed. He used to be an ace, now he's just adequate.

Swanson is a big league ready starter who should be starting over Hernandez and Sheffield despite his flyball tendencies which will be mitigated by Seattle's park.

Milone could become the next breakout starter for the Mariners. He got strikeouts and limited walks last season between AAA and the majors.

Elias is a good swingman option for the Mariners.

MIA SP: Urena is a good starter who the Marlins should trade for prospects. His improved groundball rate is key to continued success.

Smith should be able to pitch better this year for positive regression in his walk rate and groundball rate which should mitigate any drop in strikeouts.

Richards should also be able to pitch better than last year for similar reasons as Smith.

Lopez is their next man up who is going to positively regress. His groundball rate looks quite tasty.

Alcantara is a top prospect who did not impress in AAA last year. The only good thing he did besides limit walks to below three per nine is generate groundballs.

Chen is a good starter who used to be even better. He is overpriced and not going anywhere unless the Marlins eat some of his contract.

Gallen is a guy who I am expecting positive regression in his walks and a small amount of positive regression in his groundball rate. Hopefully he gets a chance to start once they trade Urena if possible.

Neidert is a Kyle Hendricks type of starter who already has plus command. He'll be better than his fastball suggests. He also will get more strikeouts than his stuff suggests.

Noesi has been pitching in the KBO over the last three seasons at a solid level by chewing innings and limiting walks while not getting a lot of strikeouts. He's a wild card who could grab some starts and do well enough to get more.

Brigham will be a plugin starter once his groundball rate improves to a useful number as his strikeouts and walks should positively regress towards his minor league numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

Hernandez was a rule 5 draft pick last year. He could go back to AA and work on stuff as a starter as he was bad as a swingman.

MIL SP: Chacin is a league average starter with the potential for more. He's tentatively the ace.

Davies was the poor man's version of Kyle Hendricks. He's a good starter who can be better than Chacin when healthy. Not much velocity, but his walks allowed are low enough.

Woodruff is tentatively the 3 starter barring any significant signings. He's ready to be tested as a starter.

Peralta is a total anomaly I have never seen before. His stats suggest he throws much harder than the 91-92 mph he throws on average for his fastball.

Burnes is a big prospect who has done well in a swingman role for the Brewers like Josh Hader has done. Unlike Harder he has more quality pitches and better command. He should be able to acquire a starting spot at any time.

Anderson is another 4 starter who can be better than that. He's a rebound candidate and he should be fine without positive regression in his peripherals.

Wilkerson is a good pitcher who has flyball tendencies which are not helped by home park.

Nelson is a wild card for this rotation. If he is back to 100% he's their ace.

TEX SP: Minor pitched like he did a few years ago when he was a great starter. Unfortunately, he more like an above average pitcher now.

Lynn is a question mark as he did better with the Yankees than with the Twins despite no peripheral changes. He should perform similarly overall to last year, but who knows what will happen.

Smyly should be healthy and effective this year. He was pretty good before TJS but it's a mystery of how he will do in 2019. Similar for Shelby Miller and Edinson Volquez except they aren't as good.

Sampson's going to be a fill-in especially if he can improve his groundball rate to previous levels.

&amp;#x200B;

SFG SP: Bumgarner is not the Ace he used to be. He's still a great pitcher to have in the rotation.

Samardzija needs to stay healthy, if he can do that then he should be able to do as well as 2017 because of a groundball regression towards pre 2017 levels and his 2017 peripherals make a 3 starter.

Holland stayed healthy and pitched better despite not gaining any velocity. He should be a quality 3 starter this year for the Giants.

Rodriguez was a pleasant surprise last season for the Giants. He should be able to pitch a healthy season and likely be a good pitcher, probably not as great as last season though.

Pomeranz is a rebound candidate who is fighting for the 5 starter spot with Andrew Suarez who performed much better than he did last year. If he can get back to his 2016-2017 levels, Suarez will have to wait for one of the top 5 guys to get injured which is not all that unlikely to happen to at least one of them.

Sampson impressed as the KBO strikeout leader. He still walks too many, but his park should help him be a threat to get some starts for the Giants.

&amp;#x200B;

Blach is an uninteresting starter who does get plenty of groundballs but has awful K/BB rates which makes him less desirable as a starter. He's also better than Beede who looked like some kind of horrible last year.

&amp;#x200B;

TOR SP: Stroman had a down year last season but he'll likely rebound to previous levels.

Shoemaker is a good pitcher when healthy, he  might also become trade bait in the summer if he does well.

Sanchez's main goal is to stay healthy. If he can do that a rebound towards his 2016 numbers.

Richard should be fine if he can improve his K/BB towards 2017 levels. He is a cheap inning chewer. Richard may also become trade bait.

Thornton is a good prospect who is ready for a shot at the majors for the first time. He's got three above average pitches and fringe average changeup with some below average command right now. He's got a pretty good chance of getting a major league spot in the rotation this year.

Reid-Foley should be expected to have positive regression in his groundball rates and walks which would lower his home run rate. However, his strikeout rate will likely go down towards his minor league levels.

Buchholz is a good starter even if his home run rate, babip and walk rate were relatively unsustainable. He should be able to have solid strikeout to walk rates and he should be a four ERA pitcher in 2019

Borucki should be able to get more strikeouts, even a small amount would be helpful especially with his groundball rate close to 50%. Of course, his strikeout rate could jump a lot higher.

Gavigilo is a good, not great starter who will likely lower his home run rate to where he does better. I like the guys above him aforementioned potential more and Toronto is giving the younger guys a chance.

Feierabend is a KBO veteran who has come back to the MLB for the BlueJays. He's a lefty who uses a knuckleball as a secondary pitch. He's been good these last two years as an inning eater who has great K/BB rates near 4.

Merryweather is a prospect coming off TJS. He needs to go to AAA to see if his stuff and command is back. Should be able to get a few starts if so.

Pannone is a fringe guy who could use more AAA time to improve his groundball rate. Waguespack is an interesting depth guy who can get groundballs.

LAA SP: Skaggs and Heaney are great when healthy, so that's the main concern. Great strikeout to walk rate guys.

Harvey should be a good pitcher who can become trade bait if needed. He has improved towards previous levels. Let's see what new coaches can help him unlock.

Cahill has suddenly become like what Tyson Ross used to be before his injury. Cahill is a massive injury risk, but he'll be a trade chip if needed.

Pena is the guy I would rather have in the 5 spot as his strikeout to walk rate is good and he gets more groundballs.

Stratton is a good fill-in starter but not one I'd want in my rotation for any extended period. Too many walks and not enough strikeouts with an ok groundball rate. He's a swingman type of guy.

Barria should be fine as the 5 starter as long as he can get his strikeouts and walks to regress towards his minor league levels. That should make his lackluster groundball rate more palatable.

Peters is a depth starter who can get groundballs. If he can get positive regression towards his minor league levels he'll be good.

ATL SP: Newcomb is a guy with troubling command/control issues. His strikeout rate will likely rebound, but he's an average starter unless he improves his walk rate or gets more groundballs.

Teheran is the former ace. He used to be good, but his walk rate went up and his peripherals hated that. His walk and strikeout rates are going to go down, but he's concerning especially since his groundball rate is sub 40%.

Wright is just about ready for the MLB, but he could use some more innings at AAA. His groundball rate should be almost as good as Fried's with none of the walk rate nightmares. Wilson's similarly ready, but less groundballs and can use more AAA time. But his K/BB rates are promising.

Fried is a graduated prospect who has had some issues staying healthy. If he was healthy and limiting walks similarly to his not as bad minor league levels he'd have been above Toussaint due to his groundball rate.

Toussaint is a prospect who has some command and control issues. He has a higher ceiling, but he should be able to outpitch Teheran right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Gohara is below Fried due to his lackluster groundball rate. His health is also a main reason why. If Gohara was healthier I'd have him above Fried.

Foltynewicz is the #1 starter when healthy, and looks like he can be good if he can keep making improvements. If he can improve his swinging strike rate his strikeout rate spike is more manageable.

Gausman is the inning chewer #2 starter who is good. Expecting his strikeout rate to go up and his peripherals to look better. He will benefit from having a quality defense behind him this season.

Soroka is an exciting prospect who is still young. He's got great control of his stuff. Expecting more strikeouts and groundballs along with less walks. This guy will be great for a long time provided he is healthy.

Tomlin is a flyball heavy starter with very good K/BB ratios, as long as he can limit home runs relatively well with his new cutter he could be a quality starting pitcher again.

Parsons is less MLB ready than Wilson and Wright, but Parsons is in line for positive regression in his groundball and strikeout rates.

Allard is a minor league depth starter prospect. He has a lackluster groundball rate and wasn't interesting last year.

SDP SP: Lucchesi is the ace of the Padres, even with a strikeout rate regression he should be able to do better as his HR/FB ratio should head back to league average.

Lauer is going to be a good pitcher, especially if he can cut down on his walks and improve his groundball rate which I am expecting to occur.

Paddack looks like a stud starting pitcher who could be the best pitcher on the padres per IP. He'll have his innings limited to about 130 in total since he threw 90 IP last year. He's got command/control, stuff and some groundball tendencies.

&amp;#x200B;

Strahm looks like a good option for a starting rotation/swingman role like Paddack likely will have. Great K/BB potential overall will help mitigate a slightly below average to below average groundball rate.

Who is Margevicius? He looks like a good pitching prospect who had terrific peripherals between A and A+ last year. He should be in AA, but he's going to start the 5th game of the year for the Padres. That's a new one on me for sure, his flyball tendencies rightly give me pause. Hopefully he'll get enough pop-ups to mitigate this.

Perdomo looks like he could have his best season in the MLB if he can get similar K/BB rates as he did last year in AAA and get a similar amount of groundballs.

Erlin is a good command/control pitcher who should be expected to have a higher walk rate this year. But, a normalized strand rate should be able to make sure that he performs better.

The cheaper Kennedy will be more useful than the expensive one. If he gets positive regression in his groundballs, walks and strikeouts he'll be able to keep a starting spot longer.

Mitchell has been nothing but confusing considering his great AAA stats and horrible stats in the MLB.

Nix needs more time in AAA to work on getting more strikeouts and limit walks effectively.

MIN SP: Berrios looks like a great starter who can eat innings with great K/BB rates with the potential for an improved walk rate.

Gibson looks like a good mid rotation guy who can maintain it if he can get his walk rate reduced along with a few more groundballs.

Odorizzi is a good back of the rotation guy who has flyball problems. Expecting a walk rate decrease and a groundball rate increase to help make it more sustainable.

Pineda is a question mark who has shown groundball tendencies and good strikeout to walk rates. Now that he doesn't have to play in as many hitter friendly parks, he should have normalized homer rates and become the 2nd best starter for the Twins.

Perez: Why? He gets groundballs but he doesn't get enough strikeouts to mitigate his walks. He should be an ok fifth starter, but why pay so much for a downgrade?! When you have a guy like Romero who is likely going to improve his strikeout and groundball rates and be as good as Odorizzi if not better? One thing to note is a fastball velocity increase which should be helpful in him gaining strikeouts, but I am skeptical.

Mejia should be as good as Perez if he performs similarly to his MLB career. He could be even better if he gets his rates similar to his recent minor league levels. Although I don't like his groundball rate it is manageable.

Thorpe is my breakout guy. His strikeout to walk rates are terrific and if he can get a 40% groundball rate he'll be a poor man's Max Scherzer. This guy should be able to get a strikeout per inning and 1/3 the walks.

Gonsalves is a top prospect who had a rough year last year. If he can get back to his 2017 form he should be fine. But for now, he's down here.

Littell had a weird season by his K/BB rates, and groundball rates. He should be expected to improve in those areas towards his minor league levels. For now, he's down here.

Stewart had a good year by his K/BB and his great groundball rate between AA, AAA and the MLB. His MLB work wasn't so good and I am skeptical until I see more sustained success.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAL SP: Bundy (TB) could be a great trade chip if he can address his flyball/home run problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cobb is too much money for his performance. That said, he is a good pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karns, health permitting he could be the best starter in the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cashner should be released as he likely won&amp;#39;t be a great trade piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hess has to go back to AAA and develop a sinker as he allows too many flyballs and homers to be able to be an effective starting pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramirez is one guy who I want to see get a crack as a full-time starting pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yacabonis is another guy who I want in the rotation over Cashner or Hess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wright was ready as anyone to replace Chris Tillman in 2017 when Tillman was clearly not ok. He should be able to fill-in acceptably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Means looks like another guy who I would rather have than Hess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CWS SP: Rodon likely will be a great bounce back candidate as he will be able to have a normal offseason to be ready for this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nova is an inning eating pitcher who can help the team by giving the team a guy who can pitch so prospects can develop and be traded for better prospects than they gave up in the offseason for Nova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopez is good right now as a starter, but he has a lot more potential to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giolito: If he can improve upon his second half he should be good. He might be sent down due to a lack of performance like Carson Fulmer was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santana had been a solid, durable mid rotation guy with solid rates. If he&amp;#39;s healthy this year unlike his bad year in 2018 he should be able to be able to take the 5 starter spot over Covey, otherwise he&amp;#39;s probably not going to make the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covey had a good stretch where he got a lot of groundballs and was doing enough in terms of strikeout to walk rates to be effective. He&amp;#39;s got a shot to start as the fifth starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banuelos pretty much fell off the face of the earth only for him to come back with the Oklahoma city Dodgers. He&amp;#39;ll be great competition for the 5th spot in the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephens is borderline MLB ready and could fill in shortly if needed. He could use some more refining in AAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cease might just fill your Michael Kopech sized void in your White Sox fan heart. He&amp;#39;s going to have to get better at limiting walks but his strikeout rate is tasty right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAK SP: Fiers will be a great pitcher at a low cost while getting strikeouts and limiting walks. Another 3 WAR season is not out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estrada&amp;#39;s flyball tendencies should be mitigated by his new home stadium and the fact that the only team in his division with a great team is Houston. A great veteran presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montas, Bassitt, Anderson, and Mengeden are all risky bets as starting pitchers but they can be good as fill-ins for Puk and Luzardo when they are ready. Anderson in particular is an injury risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackburn could be a good starter with his skill at limiting walks. He should be able to start in place of one of the three above and will do just as good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brooks, Alexander, and Bridwell are minor league depth who can make a big league start in a pinch. Doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;ll like the results. Alexander is the most promising of the three and the biggest hothead. His work in independent ball and Mexico has been impressive enough to get him a spring training invite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DET SP: Boyd is a good pitcher who solidified his own rotation spot last season. He could be even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman is a slightly overpriced veteran starting pitcher. He did well and can do even better if he can get his groundball rate up to previous levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ross (TB) is one of my favorite groundballers who can do even better with more time away from his surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardy is good swingman who deserves a chance to start with the Tigers. Much better than Matt Moore and could be even better if he gets a full season of starts in. I&amp;#39;d expect his innings to be limited to 155 as he got 112 1/3 last season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turnbull was particularly exciting in small AAA and MLB samples. He could be quite good as he also got 45%+ groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moore should be released in spring training unless he shows he has fixed some things. Maybe he should be a multi inning relief pitcher first and then he can start. Because last year was disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norris needs to be able to stay healthy and be consistent with his performance. That&amp;#39;s the most important as he&amp;#39;s been able to do well when healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m intrigued by Hall and I want to see him start in the rotation full time. It might be 2020 when I see that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carpenter is a better version of David Hess as he can get more strikeouts and limit walks better than Hess while getting more groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KCR SP: Duffy had a down year, hopefully he can return to his previous levels in 2016-2017. He&amp;#39;s tentatively the &amp;quot;ace&amp;quot; of the Royals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junis was the Royals best pitcher last year and he could do better if his HR/FB ratio goes down to league average. In addition, he has potential to get more groundballs and limit the chance of himself allowing home runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keller will regress in his performance yet still be a good pitcher. His strikeout rate will go up, but so will his walks and home runs allowed. His groundball tendencies are quite helpful especially when his flyballs are mitigated by his home stadium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellis is one of the Royals rule 5 draft picks. He appears to be ready to fill in a rotation spot based on his AAA performance and groundball rate which can be mitigated by his new home stadium as it was 38% in the PCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bailey has come here to Kansas City to try for a starting role. He&amp;#39;s likely going to do better than last year but he&amp;#39;ll probably just miss the 4 starter spot to Ellis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is a good pitcher by strikeouts and walks, but his flyball tendencies are not mitigated enough by Kauffman Stadium. If he can get his groundball rate back into the mid-30&amp;#39;s then he can be more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopez and Fillmyer don&amp;#39;t impress me by their K/BB but they get enough groundballs to mitigate that issue. I prefer Fillmyer because he has been able to pitch more innings recently than Lopez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalish looks like a good pitcher if he can get his groundball rate back to his minor league levels. Better than Lively and the two above him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lively and Sparkman are two depth guys who did well in AAA. I personally prefer Lively, but acknowledge that Sparkman has a higher floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barlow could use some work on his command as his 4 BB/9 in the PCL won&amp;#39;t cut it in the majors. Although the time he spent last year as a long reliever in a small sample did impress as he had 9 K/9 to 1.8 BB/9 which if he can approximate such performance he could be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEA SP: Marcos Gonzales was one of their breakout starting pitchers last year. He got strikeouts and limited walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leake was predictable as usual and was his usual, boring self that continues to chew innings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kikuchi was very good in Japan last season and was even better in 2017. He should be able to perform similarly to Maeda with more walks and more strikeouts than Mikolas. He&amp;#39;s a much better and harder throwing version of Kei Igawa that can get groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wade LeBlanc should do as well as he did last season as the Mariners second starting pitcher breakout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheffield: High octane pitching prospect who has already been traded twice in his short career. (The Andrew Miller trade and now the James Paxton deal this offseason.). He needs to work on command/control of his great stuff. He&amp;#39;s tentatively the fifth starter but the Mariners will sneak in some starts for aging ace Felix Hernandez. Frankly, Sheffield should have a tune up in AAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hernandez: Get this guy to driveline baseball ASAP to see what can be fixed. He used to be an ace, now he&amp;#39;s just adequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swanson is a big league ready starter who should be starting over Hernandez and Sheffield despite his flyball tendencies which will be mitigated by Seattle&amp;#39;s park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milone could become the next breakout starter for the Mariners. He got strikeouts and limited walks last season between AAA and the majors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elias is a good swingman option for the Mariners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIA SP: Urena is a good starter who the Marlins should trade for prospects. His improved groundball rate is key to continued success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith should be able to pitch better this year for positive regression in his walk rate and groundball rate which should mitigate any drop in strikeouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richards should also be able to pitch better than last year for similar reasons as Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopez is their next man up who is going to positively regress. His groundball rate looks quite tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcantara is a top prospect who did not impress in AAA last year. The only good thing he did besides limit walks to below three per nine is generate groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen is a good starter who used to be even better. He is overpriced and not going anywhere unless the Marlins eat some of his contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallen is a guy who I am expecting positive regression in his walks and a small amount of positive regression in his groundball rate. Hopefully he gets a chance to start once they trade Urena if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neidert is a Kyle Hendricks type of starter who already has plus command. He&amp;#39;ll be better than his fastball suggests. He also will get more strikeouts than his stuff suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noesi has been pitching in the KBO over the last three seasons at a solid level by chewing innings and limiting walks while not getting a lot of strikeouts. He&amp;#39;s a wild card who could grab some starts and do well enough to get more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham will be a plugin starter once his groundball rate improves to a useful number as his strikeouts and walks should positively regress towards his minor league numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hernandez was a rule 5 draft pick last year. He could go back to AA and work on stuff as a starter as he was bad as a swingman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIL SP: Chacin is a league average starter with the potential for more. He&amp;#39;s tentatively the ace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davies was the poor man&amp;#39;s version of Kyle Hendricks. He&amp;#39;s a good starter who can be better than Chacin when healthy. Not much velocity, but his walks allowed are low enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woodruff is tentatively the 3 starter barring any significant signings. He&amp;#39;s ready to be tested as a starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peralta is a total anomaly I have never seen before. His stats suggest he throws much harder than the 91-92 mph he throws on average for his fastball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burnes is a big prospect who has done well in a swingman role for the Brewers like Josh Hader has done. Unlike Harder he has more quality pitches and better command. He should be able to acquire a starting spot at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anderson is another 4 starter who can be better than that. He&amp;#39;s a rebound candidate and he should be fine without positive regression in his peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkerson is a good pitcher who has flyball tendencies which are not helped by home park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nelson is a wild card for this rotation. If he is back to 100% he&amp;#39;s their ace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEX SP: Minor pitched like he did a few years ago when he was a great starter. Unfortunately, he more like an above average pitcher now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynn is a question mark as he did better with the Yankees than with the Twins despite no peripheral changes. He should perform similarly overall to last year, but who knows what will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smyly should be healthy and effective this year. He was pretty good before TJS but it&amp;#39;s a mystery of how he will do in 2019. Similar for Shelby Miller and Edinson Volquez except they aren&amp;#39;t as good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sampson&amp;#39;s going to be a fill-in especially if he can improve his groundball rate to previous levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SFG SP: Bumgarner is not the Ace he used to be. He&amp;#39;s still a great pitcher to have in the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samardzija needs to stay healthy, if he can do that then he should be able to do as well as 2017 because of a groundball regression towards pre 2017 levels and his 2017 peripherals make a 3 starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holland stayed healthy and pitched better despite not gaining any velocity. He should be a quality 3 starter this year for the Giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez was a pleasant surprise last season for the Giants. He should be able to pitch a healthy season and likely be a good pitcher, probably not as great as last season though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pomeranz is a rebound candidate who is fighting for the 5 starter spot with Andrew Suarez who performed much better than he did last year. If he can get back to his 2016-2017 levels, Suarez will have to wait for one of the top 5 guys to get injured which is not all that unlikely to happen to at least one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sampson impressed as the KBO strikeout leader. He still walks too many, but his park should help him be a threat to get some starts for the Giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blach is an uninteresting starter who does get plenty of groundballs but has awful K/BB rates which makes him less desirable as a starter. He&amp;#39;s also better than Beede who looked like some kind of horrible last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOR SP: Stroman had a down year last season but he&amp;#39;ll likely rebound to previous levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoemaker is a good pitcher when healthy, he  might also become trade bait in the summer if he does well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanchez&amp;#39;s main goal is to stay healthy. If he can do that a rebound towards his 2016 numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard should be fine if he can improve his K/BB towards 2017 levels. He is a cheap inning chewer. Richard may also become trade bait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thornton is a good prospect who is ready for a shot at the majors for the first time. He&amp;#39;s got three above average pitches and fringe average changeup with some below average command right now. He&amp;#39;s got a pretty good chance of getting a major league spot in the rotation this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reid-Foley should be expected to have positive regression in his groundball rates and walks which would lower his home run rate. However, his strikeout rate will likely go down towards his minor league levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buchholz is a good starter even if his home run rate, babip and walk rate were relatively unsustainable. He should be able to have solid strikeout to walk rates and he should be a four ERA pitcher in 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borucki should be able to get more strikeouts, even a small amount would be helpful especially with his groundball rate close to 50%. Of course, his strikeout rate could jump a lot higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gavigilo is a good, not great starter who will likely lower his home run rate to where he does better. I like the guys above him aforementioned potential more and Toronto is giving the younger guys a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feierabend is a KBO veteran who has come back to the MLB for the BlueJays. He&amp;#39;s a lefty who uses a knuckleball as a secondary pitch. He&amp;#39;s been good these last two years as an inning eater who has great K/BB rates near 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merryweather is a prospect coming off TJS. He needs to go to AAA to see if his stuff and command is back. Should be able to get a few starts if so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pannone is a fringe guy who could use more AAA time to improve his groundball rate. Waguespack is an interesting depth guy who can get groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAA SP: Skaggs and Heaney are great when healthy, so that&amp;#39;s the main concern. Great strikeout to walk rate guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvey should be a good pitcher who can become trade bait if needed. He has improved towards previous levels. Let&amp;#39;s see what new coaches can help him unlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cahill has suddenly become like what Tyson Ross used to be before his injury. Cahill is a massive injury risk, but he&amp;#39;ll be a trade chip if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pena is the guy I would rather have in the 5 spot as his strikeout to walk rate is good and he gets more groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stratton is a good fill-in starter but not one I&amp;#39;d want in my rotation for any extended period. Too many walks and not enough strikeouts with an ok groundball rate. He&amp;#39;s a swingman type of guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barria should be fine as the 5 starter as long as he can get his strikeouts and walks to regress towards his minor league levels. That should make his lackluster groundball rate more palatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peters is a depth starter who can get groundballs. If he can get positive regression towards his minor league levels he&amp;#39;ll be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATL SP: Newcomb is a guy with troubling command/control issues. His strikeout rate will likely rebound, but he&amp;#39;s an average starter unless he improves his walk rate or gets more groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teheran is the former ace. He used to be good, but his walk rate went up and his peripherals hated that. His walk and strikeout rates are going to go down, but he&amp;#39;s concerning especially since his groundball rate is sub 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wright is just about ready for the MLB, but he could use some more innings at AAA. His groundball rate should be almost as good as Fried&amp;#39;s with none of the walk rate nightmares. Wilson&amp;#39;s similarly ready, but less groundballs and can use more AAA time. But his K/BB rates are promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fried is a graduated prospect who has had some issues staying healthy. If he was healthy and limiting walks similarly to his not as bad minor league levels he&amp;#39;d have been above Toussaint due to his groundball rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toussaint is a prospect who has some command and control issues. He has a higher ceiling, but he should be able to outpitch Teheran right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gohara is below Fried due to his lackluster groundball rate. His health is also a main reason why. If Gohara was healthier I&amp;#39;d have him above Fried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foltynewicz is the #1 starter when healthy, and looks like he can be good if he can keep making improvements. If he can improve his swinging strike rate his strikeout rate spike is more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gausman is the inning chewer #2 starter who is good. Expecting his strikeout rate to go up and his peripherals to look better. He will benefit from having a quality defense behind him this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soroka is an exciting prospect who is still young. He&amp;#39;s got great control of his stuff. Expecting more strikeouts and groundballs along with less walks. This guy will be great for a long time provided he is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomlin is a flyball heavy starter with very good K/BB ratios, as long as he can limit home runs relatively well with his new cutter he could be a quality starting pitcher again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parsons is less MLB ready than Wilson and Wright, but Parsons is in line for positive regression in his groundball and strikeout rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allard is a minor league depth starter prospect. He has a lackluster groundball rate and wasn&amp;#39;t interesting last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SDP SP: Lucchesi is the ace of the Padres, even with a strikeout rate regression he should be able to do better as his HR/FB ratio should head back to league average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauer is going to be a good pitcher, especially if he can cut down on his walks and improve his groundball rate which I am expecting to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paddack looks like a stud starting pitcher who could be the best pitcher on the padres per IP. He&amp;#39;ll have his innings limited to about 130 in total since he threw 90 IP last year. He&amp;#39;s got command/control, stuff and some groundball tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strahm looks like a good option for a starting rotation/swingman role like Paddack likely will have. Great K/BB potential overall will help mitigate a slightly below average to below average groundball rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is Margevicius? He looks like a good pitching prospect who had terrific peripherals between A and A+ last year. He should be in AA, but he&amp;#39;s going to start the 5th game of the year for the Padres. That&amp;#39;s a new one on me for sure, his flyball tendencies rightly give me pause. Hopefully he&amp;#39;ll get enough pop-ups to mitigate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perdomo looks like he could have his best season in the MLB if he can get similar K/BB rates as he did last year in AAA and get a similar amount of groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erlin is a good command/control pitcher who should be expected to have a higher walk rate this year. But, a normalized strand rate should be able to make sure that he performs better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheaper Kennedy will be more useful than the expensive one. If he gets positive regression in his groundballs, walks and strikeouts he&amp;#39;ll be able to keep a starting spot longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchell has been nothing but confusing considering his great AAA stats and horrible stats in the MLB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nix needs more time in AAA to work on getting more strikeouts and limit walks effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIN SP: Berrios looks like a great starter who can eat innings with great K/BB rates with the potential for an improved walk rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibson looks like a good mid rotation guy who can maintain it if he can get his walk rate reduced along with a few more groundballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odorizzi is a good back of the rotation guy who has flyball problems. Expecting a walk rate decrease and a groundball rate increase to help make it more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pineda is a question mark who has shown groundball tendencies and good strikeout to walk rates. Now that he doesn&amp;#39;t have to play in as many hitter friendly parks, he should have normalized homer rates and become the 2nd best starter for the Twins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perez: Why? He gets groundballs but he doesn&amp;#39;t get enough strikeouts to mitigate his walks. He should be an ok fifth starter, but why pay so much for a downgrade?! When you have a guy like Romero who is likely going to improve his strikeout and groundball rates and be as good as Odorizzi if not better? One thing to note is a fastball velocity increase which should be helpful in him gaining strikeouts, but I am skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mejia should be as good as Perez if he performs similarly to his MLB career. He could be even better if he gets his rates similar to his recent minor league levels. Although I don&amp;#39;t like his groundball rate it is manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thorpe is my breakout guy. His strikeout to walk rates are terrific and if he can get a 40% groundball rate he&amp;#39;ll be a poor man&amp;#39;s Max Scherzer. This guy should be able to get a strikeout per inning and 1/3 the walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gonsalves is a top prospect who had a rough year last year. If he can get back to his 2017 form he should be fine. But for now, he&amp;#39;s down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Littell had a weird season by his K/BB rates, and groundball rates. He should be expected to improve in those areas towards his minor league levels. For now, he&amp;#39;s down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart had a good year by his K/BB and his great groundball rate between AA, AAA and the MLB. His MLB work wasn&amp;#39;t so good and I am skeptical until I see more sustained success.&lt;/p&gt;

The last two second halfs (2017-18), daily PLIMP tables have been posted in the Around the Horn threads. What is PLIMP? [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/907lli/reintroducing_plimp_v_20/) from last year gives an explanation.

In short, PLIMP is a calculation that utilizes [538's playoff odds](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-mlb-predictions/) (both percent chance of making the playoffs and winning one's division) to attempt to describe which games have the most impact on the playoff picture. It is the result of work done between myself and /u/cardith_lorda (who is the mastermind behind the math). You could think of the PLIMP table as a daily viewing guide.

Over the past two seasons, PLIMP was only rolled out in the second half once playoff odds were more representative of reality over projections, but I figured it'd be fun to keep track of it over the whole season this year.

What's different in PLIMP this year vs. last year? See [this comment from /u/cardith_lorda](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/9gjwea/general_discussion_around_the_horn_91718/e669isb/?context=3) that explains why last year's version was a little wonky. The math behind PLIMP has been adjusted this year so that the maximum PLIMP a game can have is now 400 instead of 1200.

Here is the full table of today's games, which will also be posted in today's Around the Horn thread:

5. Strahm

Logan Allen and Cal Quantrill were to compete in their final start to see who would take that last rotation spot. Both gave up 7 runs (with Quantrill’s not being attributed to him) in a 24 run loss to the Cubs. That being said, neither seems likely to be put in the rotation after equally awful performances. Allen has a double digit ERA this Spring, and Quantrill has given up an unbelievable amount of hits. 

Nick Margevicius is the only option left that hasn’t been shelled or announced as out of contention from the rotation spot, yet he hasn’t pitched above A ball in his career, making him unlikely as well.

The likes of Robbie Erlin, Luis Perdomo, and Bryan Mitchell have been announced as out of the race for the final start, leaving Allen, Quantrill, and Margevicius as the 3 candidates for the #3 rotation spot. 

So will it be one of them? Will they try an opener/bullpen day? Will they bring in Dallas Keuchel, who’ve they’ve had contact with this offseason? Dan Straily? Or will they pull off a big trade with a team like the Indians, who they’ve been heavily connected to? 

Also, has something like this happened before? I can’t recall a team every being in a position where they’ve left their 3rd rotation spot open less than 24 hours before opening day with no clear candidate.

Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez each made their debuts with the Blue Jays in 2014, with Stroman pitching in the rotation for half of the season, and Sanchez pitching in the bullpen. 

After an impressive debut in 2014, big things were expected of both in 2015. Unfortunately, Stroman [tore his ACL early in spring training](https://www.si.com/mlb/2015/03/10/marcus-stroman-blue-jays-torn-acl-out-season), and was thought to be lost for the season. Meanwhile, the Jays’ bullpen needs saw Sanchez spend another season pitching in relief, eventually becoming the team’s setup man. Stroman went on to recover from his injury well ahead of schedule, and pitched for the Jays as a starter down the stretch and through the playoffs.

Not only did the pair seem to be promising young pitchers for the Jays - they also appeared to be best of friends. At one time, Stroman’s social media was full of posts featuring the two of them, and “StroChez” had become a real bromance in the minds of Jays fans.

With their relationship as strong as ever, Sanchez had a tremendous season in 2016, a year in which he finally transitioned to a starter, and led the American League with an ERA of 3.00. As any promising young starting pitcher should do, Sanchez decided to hire Scott Boras to be his agent that winter.

That’s when everything changed. And this is when Reddit became involved.

Full credit is due to /u/sugardaddymac, who has kept up on the “Strochez” drama since the 2016 off-season. In [a post from January, 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/5m3y0s/are_stroman_and_sanchez_feuding/), he found that the pair no longer followed each other on social media. Even more telling, he noted that immediately after the Boras hiring, Stroman tweeted ""Be extremely cautious of who you let in your life and put on your wave"" followed by ""Less is more, there's plenty of us.”

A few weeks later, when reached for comment, Stroman said “We’re still friends. We’re not as close, but we’re still friends.
We’re not as close, we’re not as close. Obviously, we go our separate ways. We’re around different people. But we’re still friends, we’re still friends. Just because we’re not together every single second of the day, people, like, lose their mind.” This statement wasn’t exactly convincing.

In the two years that followed, Stroman and Sanchez had not acknowledged each other on social media. Comments from the local beat writers suggested that the two had very much grown distant. StroChez appeared to be over.

But leave it to /u/sugardaddymac, who earlier this week [discovered that Stroman had followed Sanchez on Instagram once again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/b50wgf/the_feud_is_over/). This planted a seed of optimism in the minds of Strochez fans.

And that brings us to today. [And this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvhMZiUnd2S/). StroChez, together at last. They appear to be on good terms again, after two long years of cold shoulders.

Two players listed on a team refers to a platoon. Players can platoon at more than one position.

Starters refer to end of the year roster. Players highlighted in white were not on the opening day roster. Because of this roster movement, a player who plays the most games at said position may not necessarily be listed as the starter.

#Introduction:
Well, here we are yet *again* (yes, again, again, again). After the long winter off-season, and the fun (for the first week or so) spring training, meaningful ""real"" baseball is finally back! Of course with the new MLB season, this means it’s time for the /r/baseball Nightly Pick ‘em... Season ~~5~~ Cinco!

* Will someone be able to take the crown from /u/crazye97, who became the first 2-time Nightly Pick ‘em Champion with 103 points in 2018?
* What about the (all-time high) 16 wins in a row that /u/CountingCastles topped out at?
* And let’s hope nobody challenges the 13 *losses* in a row that /u/ihavearedditaccount hit! (Which was just 1 loss shy all-time high set by /u/ghostelephant in 2017)

#Contributors:
* As always, big thank you to /u/vacuum2440 who set up all the behind the scenes stuff, and without whom all this would not be possible.
* Secondly, thank you to the ever-present /u/crazye97 who will yet again be be helping out over the course of the season posting threads for me in the off chance that I’m unavailable, or forget, or whatever else might come up. **I would also maybe like to have one more person help us out just in case, so just PM me if you’re interested.**

#How to Play:
Every day ***starting this Thursday March 28th***, usually around Midnight EST I will post a daily thread about today's game of choice, which is determined by a vote from the previous day. I will not only include a link to a Google Doc form where you can make your pick for who will win, but some other information such as leaders, and other fun facts. After making your pick, you're also encouraged to confirm it in the comments of that day's pick thread, just in case your selection for some reason wasn’t recorded, or you misspell your username (but please don't), or make the wrong selection on the form (please try not to do that either).

If you pick the winner, you get a point! If you pick the loser, you get zero points. Every day we’ll be keeping track of overall leaders, monthly leaders, as well as longest active winning, and losing streaks.

#Returning From 2018: Prizes!
**Grand Prize**: *Awarded to the overall regular season Champion.*

* **Custom Flair Hover Text**

You will win the right to have your own custom flair hover text! When someone hovers over your flair, as opposed to the your team's name what it reads will be entirely up to you\* 

\* ^\(Within ^reason, ^pending ^mod ^approval)

* **$30 MLB.com Gift Card**

Pretty self explanatory, at the conclusion of the season I will send the Champion a $30 digital gift card for MLBShop.com.

#Features Returning From Previous Years:
*Sunday Night Baseball: Every week the Sunday night game is whatever the ESPN Sunday Night Baseball matchup is; Seeing as it's a nationally televised game, and usually has some pretty good contests. I usually replace the next game vote on Saturday with something humorous, and people tend to enjoy this, so it'll continue to be another Sunday tradition unless there's position.
* In 2016 season we added a ""Lucky Guess"" feature to spice up Sunday games. In addition to picking the winner, I would ask a question like ""What player will get the first hit of the game?"" or ""How many innings will (Starting Pitcher) throw?"" Where if guessed correctly, a user would receive an extra bonus point. This feature will be returning this season, and I have some more new, fun questions to ask! Of course suggestions for questions are always welcome, so make a comment, or shoot me a PM if you have some good ideas; I’ll of course give you credit if/when your question is used!
* Daily Push Notifications: This has been asked for by a handful of you, and in 2017 it was finally implemented. You can get daily push notifications sent directly to your phone whenever a daily thread is posted! It’s completely free, and [the instructions for setting this up are located here](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballnightlypick/comments/630qaz/how_to_set_up_email_or_phone_notifications_for/) (works for both Android and iOS). With this system in place you (should) never forget to pick again!
* Also in 2016 season thanks to /u/crazye97, we added a new tab to the standings sheet called ""Matchups Heat Map"". This shows how many times particular matchups had been picked, and was overall just always interesting to check on every few weeks. It’s pretty fun to check out every now and then, so give it a look!
* A few years ago I added a ""Hall of Fame"" tab to the standings sheet to keep track of all-time records like longest streaks, and previous monthly winners. I think it’s pretty cool to look back on the (now) 5 year history of this game, so I wanted to directly mention it.

#Things I’m Looking for Feedback On:
* Since the inaugural season we’ve enforced a ""Once Per Series"" rule. What that means is once a matchup has been picked, it was omitted from being picked again that series. That prevented having the same matchup picked multiple nights in a row. Yes, Astros vs Yankees is an attractive matchup, but who wants to pick the same matchup 3 nights in a row? I plan on keeping that rule this year, but of course if the majority wants, I could do away with it. So please let me know if there’s any major objections to this rule.
* Also since early in the first season, we had a ""Night Games Only"" rule enforced during the week. This was implemented for a  few reasons; One being this is a ""*Nightly* Pick"", and secondly a bunch of users were complaining that they kept missing picks because games being picked were starting at 1 PM or earlier during the week. This rule is only applied Monday-Friday (so all weekend games are up to be voted on), and special occasions (Opening Day, 4th of July, Memorial Day, etc). I’m planning on continuing this rule moving forward, but again if you would all like that to be changed, please let me know.

#The First Game
Seeing as this year (almost) *everyone* is playing on Opening Day, there are multiple possibilities for the first game. That being said, visit [the submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9MO5Shm6V12DR3GOlACWCuwRibWw7a4w4hX4Dn4RQYwEPFw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to cast your vote for what teams should start out the season. Everyone cast a vote, and I’ll hopefully see you all (and many more) tomorrow!

I hate cliches. I hate when people's brains use them in place of an original thought. I hate that baseball, my favorite sport, is littered with them. We're taking it one game at a time. He plays the game the right way. That ball had eyes.

The one that I never minded - hope springs eternal. This cliche, while on the surface appearing to be pretty simple, has many layers. The commencement of baseball season not only means homers and strikeouts - it means longer days and sunshine and the end of Winter, shotgunning beers in the parking lot with your boys and teaching your girl how to keep score. It means gambling on the player's statistics and having your usher buddy sneak you into the good seats. It's Americana at it's finest - especially on the North Shore in Pittsburgh, PA.

Hope springs eternal .... in most places. The only thing springing eternal in Baltimore this Summer will be Natty Boh's on Eutaw Street, drowning away 100+ losses. The only thing that Oracle Park in San Francisco, the second nicest yard behind PNC Park, will be showing off in Bruce Bochy's final year is a cast of overpaid past-their-primers playing the hits one more time, a tribute band to the ""even year magic"" dynasty. It wasn't long ago that Texas and Detroit were making deep playoff runs annually, this season their goal will be to avoid the cellar. The Diamondbacks, who went for it in recent years, will take a Summer off from any playoff aspirations after moving their franchise player. The Royals, a small-market team that admirably went for it and reached the promised land, will also sit out the calendar year of 2019.

I can say these things with certainty, because you can't cheat baseball. You can't cheat 162. You can make the playoffs in the NFL with some breaks - a soft schedule, a kicker gets the shanks, a couple turnovers at the right time. With only 16 games, you need a couple to swing your way to have a playoff season. You can't do that in baseball.

&amp;#x200B;

**You Win With Pitching**

Another cliche? Fuggit, it's Steve Blass' last season, let's keep it rolling.

The reason for hope in Pittsburgh this season is the pitching staff. The Pirates have a trump card, an ace up their sleeve if you will, in the form of run prevention ([https://www.reddit.com/r/buccos/comments/ayuzp8/its\_not\_sexy\_but\_the\_pirates\_win\_with\_run/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buccos/comments/ayuzp8/its_not_sexy_but_the_pirates_win_with_run/)).

This is why the Pirates aren't dead on March 26th. This is why we aren't already voted off the island like the aforementioned ball clubs above. This is the formula that worked for us when we won the second most games in MLB from 2013-2015.

Just this week : FanGraphs projected our rotation as the 9th best in MLB - [https://blogs.fangraphs.com/2019-positional-power-rankings-starting-rotation-no-1-15/](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/2019-positional-power-rankings-starting-rotation-no-1-15/)

[MLB.com](https://mlb.com/) gave our bullpen the 3rd ranking in baseball - [https://www.mlb.com/news/baseball-s-top-10-bullpens-going-into-2019](https://www.mlb.com/news/baseball-s-top-10-bullpens-going-into-2019)

Having a shutdown bullpen or starters that ""keep you in the game,"" aren't going to move the turnstiles, but they'll keep your head above water. It's a long summer, full of peaks and valleys, and as the great Andy Van Slyke once said, ""the goal is to avoid the Grand Canyon.""

The pitching staff is strong, top to bottom, both in the rotation and the pen. There are teams that would kill (or overpay) to have the quality arms that the Bucs possess. The rotation has been discussed a lot, but the bullpen is where the Bucs could really gain a huge edge on the diamond. The Pirates can compete with a mediocre Pythagorean Record ([https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Pythagorean\_Theorem\_of\_Baseball](https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Pythagorean_Theorem_of_Baseball)) by locking down games, turning nine innings into six, making one-run leads hold up.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Nutting Problem**

I'm torn between what I hate more - our frugal owner or the tired responses of lazy Pirates fans, usually ones that don't care to understand all of the facts. I often get criticized as a defender of Nutting when it's really just total apathy. I know the Nutting story as well as anyone. We share the same home town. I've had family members work for his low-paying newspaper. I've donated countless thousand of dollars in season tickets and playoff tickets and $7 beers over the last 15 years. He sucks, I know.

Complaining about Nutting is like complaining about Trump. The majority of us would prefer alternatives, but the majority of us don't have millions upon billions of cash laying around in the bank to do anything about it - Nutting isn't going to read a reddit comment and decide to sell his team. I would prefer to spend my energy on praise for Neal Huntington, who may very well be the best general manager in baseball. If there was a stat that equated dollars spent to wins accumulated, our guy would have to be at the top. He's not a flash in the pan, either. He came in with a vision, and soup to nuts has mostly delivered on his plan.

Huntington said that the goal wasn't to chase one winning season that would end our twenty year streak of ineptitude, it was to build a consistent winner. And while some years have been hit and some have been miss, the product is by and large far, far, far superior to the previous decades before him. Not only are the Bucs competitive at the major league level, they have a crop of talent in the minors that rivals any class we have graduated. Andrew McCutchen was mostly doing it by himself until Tony Watson (2011), Starling Marte (2012), Justin Wilson (2012), Gerrit Cole (2013), Gregory Polanco (2014), Josh Bell (2016), Jameson Taillon (2016), Trevor Williams (2016) and Adam Frazier (2016) arrived - the hits have kept coming from within.

Add Ke'Bryan Hayes, Mitch Keller, Cole Tucker, Oneil Cruz, Travis Swaggerty to the mix - Huntington formulated and executed a plan. He's the real CEO of our company, and I'd prefer to focus on his success instead of hearing another shit joke about our owner.

&amp;#x200B;

**There's More Than One Way to Skin a Cat**

A classic trap with baseball fans is they only think like a fantasy player. They see the numbers on the back of the baseball cards, the way our fathers and grandfathers did, and think that's the bottom line. Homers. Average. RBIs.

Lucky for us as Pirates fans, and thanks to modern analytics, there's way more to the game than those stats. A small market team could never compete if those were the only numbers that mattered.

Let's take the case of Mike Moustakas. I've seen multiple people on multiple occasions on this web site clamoring for his services. He's had a fine career. He won a World Series. He once hit 38 bombs in a season, yet had trouble finding suitors the following season before settling for a lot less $$ than many thought he deserved.

Moustakas seems like a nice guy, but his power is his only real asset. His glove is eh, and he will have to try to handle second base to crack a line-up. He strikes out way too much compared to the infrequent times he walks. He is not a threat on the bases, to put it kindly.

These things matter! Starling Marte is one of the best outfielders in the game, despite pedestrian power numbers. He covers as much ground as anyone in center. He has a cannon attached to his right shoulder. He is a problem on the bases, not just stealing bases and pestering pitchers, but getting first-to-third on base hits.

Adam Frazier is a superior option to Moustakas. He's another guy who adds way more value than just home runs. In just 352 PAs last season, Frazier posted a 2.7 WAR. In that season when Moustakas hit 38 HRs? He posted a 1.9 WAR in 598 ABs. Frazier can pick it, he can run, he can get on base. No less an authority than David Freese expects him to win a batting title in his career. Thanks to modern analytics, we can see he's a better baseball player. Yet our grandfathers and reddit posters would all take Moustakas in a heartbeat.

&amp;#x200B;

**There's Hope For Upside**

There will always be a ton of variance in baseball, more than any other sport. It's how a guy can hit .320 one season, and .250 the next. A guy can follow a 35 homer season with 15 the following in as many at-bats. Round ball, round bat.

The Pirates have a roster not only filled with talent, not only filled with depth, but with upside for more. Chris Archer is a former ace who dominated the toughest lineups in the AL East for years. He's only 30 years old. Ray Searage and the FO have done a lot with starting pitchers not nearly the ilk of Archer - J.A. Happ, A.J. Burnett, Edinson Volquez, Jeff Locke, Francisco Liriano. Hell, they turned Vance Worley into a useful starter for a stretch. If Archer was a stock, you'd be crazy to not buy now. The upside far outweighs the risk.

Offensively, I'm looking at Josh Bell, Jung Ho Kang and Adam Frazier. This trio has all shown the ability to hit big level pitching with authority. Would it shock anyone if any of these guys made an All-Star game this Summer? They have the ability to be great. If two of the three can pop this Summer, we could be in business. Don't sleep on Lonnie Chisenhall either - injuries have derailed his last two seasons, but he also mashed when healthy. He should be able to hold down RF until Gregory Polanco, another guy with untapped upside and coming off a career year, re-joins the lineup.

&amp;#x200B;

**The NL Central Will Be a Rock Fight**

Some may look at this as a deterrent for a successful season, I look at it more optimistically. All five teams in our division are projected to win between 78-89 games. Whereas the Cubs were the odds on favorites the last couple seasons, the gauntlet of the NL Central will turn the pennant chase into a war of attrition. The Brewers may have the best and deepest lineup in baseball, the Cubs are still loaded, the Cardinals keep the line moving every Summer with amazing consistency, and even the Reds made a big splash in the offseason, both financially and to the roster. It's the deepest and most likely, best, division in baseball. Iron sharpens iron.

The bottom line - enjoy this season. Instead of bitching about Nutting, appreciate Huntington. Instead of clamoring for Moustakas, watch as Adam Frazier masters his craft. We didn't make a run at Harper or Machado?? Corey Dickerson and Jung Ho Kang are pretty damned good ball players, we are lucky to have them. You'd rather have Gio Gonzalez over Jordan Lyles or Nick Kingham? of course you would, despite Huntington's track record. Let's take it one game at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it shock anyone if any of these guys made an All-Star game this Summer? They have the ability to be great. If two of the three can pop this Summer, we could be in business. Don&amp;#39;t sleep on Lonnie Chisenhall either - injuries have derailed his last two seasons, but he also mashed when healthy. He should be able to hold down RF until Gregory Polanco, another guy with untapped upside and coming off a career year, re-joins the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NL Central Will Be a Rock Fight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may look at this as a deterrent for a successful season, I look at it more optimistically. All five teams in our division are projected to win between 78-89 games. Whereas the Cubs were the odds on favorites the last couple seasons, the gauntlet of the NL Central will turn the pennant chase into a war of attrition. The Brewers may have the best and deepest lineup in baseball, the Cubs are still loaded, the Cardinals keep the line moving every Summer with amazing consistency, and even the Reds made a big splash in the offseason, both financially and to the roster. It&amp;#39;s the deepest and most likely, best, division in baseball. Iron sharpens iron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line - enjoy this season. Instead of bitching about Nutting, appreciate Huntington. Instead of clamoring for Moustakas, watch as Adam Frazier masters his craft. We didn&amp;#39;t make a run at Harper or Machado?? Corey Dickerson and Jung Ho Kang are pretty damned good ball players, we are lucky to have them. You&amp;#39;d rather have Gio Gonzalez over Jordan Lyles or Nick Kingham? of course you would, despite Huntington&amp;#39;s track record. Let&amp;#39;s take it one game at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope springs eternal. Let&amp;#39;s Go Bucs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Just wanted to share something baseball related that me and my dad have done for 12 years now that’s been a great bonding experience and one of my favorite things we do together. 

Tonight marked the 12th annual homerun derby that me and my father have been doing since I was a teenager. We even have a traveling trophy that goes back and forth based on who wins. Complete with customized (stick on) plaques with the name and year of the winner. 

Every year we select 7 players on who we think will got the most homerun this coming year. 

Basic Rules:
First 2 picks  are allowed from the previous years top 20 in HR. 
The next 4 are from #21 down. 
The 7th is an alternate pick and doesn’t count unless switched for another player within the first month. After that the picks lock. 

Last year was our first ever tie and we had to come up with playoff rules. We each happened to have 4 players in playoffs so we just went off playoff homeruns. Machado carries me to the ship.

In 11 years he leads 6-5 including a 4 year win streak at one point. 
 
We also added in my brother in-law this year so it’s the first time we will be at 3 people in the season this year. 

Just wanted to share we just finished the draft and I’m excited for the season to really get going!
